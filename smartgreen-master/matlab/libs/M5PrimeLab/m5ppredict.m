function [Yq, contrib] = m5ppredict(model, Xq)
% m5ppredict
% Predicts response values for the given query points Xq using M5' tree,
% decision rule set, or ensemble of trees. For unsmoothed regression trees
% (whether in ensembles or as individual trees), can also provide a matrix
% of input variable contributions to the response value for each row of Xq.
%
% Call:
%   [Yq, contrib] = m5ppredict(model, Xq)
%
% Input:
%   model         : M5' model, decision rule set, or a cell array of M5'
%                   models, if ensemble of trees is to be used.
%   Xq            : A matrix of query data points. Missing values in Xq
%                   must be indicated as NaN.
%
% Output:
%   Yq            : A column vector of predicted response values. If model
%                   is an ensemble, Yq is a matrix whose rows correspond to
%                   Xq rows (i.e., observations) and columns correspond to
%                   each ensemble size (i.e., the increasing number of
%                   trees), the values in the very last column being the
%                   values for a full ensemble.
%   contrib       : Available only for unsmoothed regression trees (whether
%                   in ensembles or as single trees) and only if m5pbuild
%                   was called with keepNodeInfo = true.
%                   A matrix of contributions of each input variable to the
%                   response for each Xq row in terms of response
%                   value changes along the prediction path of a tree so
%                   that Yq = training_set_mean + x1_contribution +
%                   x2_contribution + ... + xn_contribution. contrib has
%                   the same number of columns as Xq plus one, the last
%                   column being the training set response mean for single
%                   trees or in-bag response mean for ensembles. The sum of
%                   columns of contrib is equal to Yq (or to the last
%                   column of Yq for ensembles).
%                   This allows interpreting single trees and whole
%                   ensembles as well as explaining their predictions. The
%                   implemented method is sometimes also called "feature
%                   contribution method" (Saabas, 2014/2015 (see this for
%                   the simplest explanation); Welling et al., 2016;
%                   Kuz’min et al., 2011; Palczewska et al., 2013). See
%                   also examples of usage in Section 3 of user's manual.
%                   Note that this function does not decompose
%                   contributions according to the Forest Floor methodology
%                   (Welling et al., 2016) as contrib is computed using the
%                   given Xq, instead of the out-of-bag data. For
%                   decomposition in accordance with Forest Floor, see
%                   output argument ensembleResults.OOBContrib of function
%                   m5pbuild.
%
% Remarks:
% 1. If the data contains categorical variables with more than two
%    categories, they are transformed into synthetic binary variables in
%    exactly the same way as m5pbuild does it.
% 2. Any previously unseen values of binary or categorical variables are
%    treated as NaN.
