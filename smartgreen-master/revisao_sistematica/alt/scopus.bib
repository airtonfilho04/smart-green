abstract={Different sensor technologies are available for dimensional metrology and reverse engineering processes. Tactile systems, optical sensors, and computed tomography (CT) are being used to an increasing extent in various industrial contexts. However, each technique has its own peculiarities, which may limit its usability in demanding applications. The measurement of complex shapes, such as those including hidden and twisted geometries, could be better afforded by multisensor systems combining the advantages of two or more data acquisition technologies. In this paper, a fully automatic multisensor methodology has been developed with the aim at performing accurate and reliable measurements of both external and internal geometries of industrial components. The methodology is based on tracking a customized hand-held tactile probe by a passive stereo vision system. The imaging system automatically tracks the probe by means of photogrammetric measurements of markers distributed over a plate rigidly assembled to the tactile frame. Moreover, the passive stereo system is activated with a structured light projector in order to provide full-field scanning data, which integrate the point-by-point measurements. The use of the same stereo vision system for both tactile probe tracking and structured light scanning allows the two different sensors to express measurement data in the same reference system, thus preventing inaccuracies due to misalignment errors occurring in the registration phase. The tactile methodology has been validated by measuring primitive shapes. Moreover, the effectiveness of the integration between tactile probing and optical scanning has been experienced by reconstructing twisted and internal shapes of industrial impellers.

abstract={This paper presents a multi-sensor fusion strategy able to detect the spurious sensors data that must be eliminated from the fusion procedure. The used estimator is the informational form of the Kalman Filter (KF) namely Information Filter (IF). In order to detect the erroneous sensors measurements, the Kullback–Leibler Divergence (KLD) between the a priori and a posteriori distributions of the IF is computed. It is generated from two tests: One acts on the means and the other deals with the covariance matrices. Optimal thresholding method based on a Kullback–Leibler Criterion (KLC) is developed and discussed in order to replace classical approaches that fix heuristically the false alarm probability. Multi-robot systems became one of the major fields of study in the indoor environment where the environmental monitoring and the response to crisis must be ensured. Consequently, the robots required to know precisely their positions and orientations in order to successfully perform their mission. Fault detection and exclusion (FDE) play a crucial role in enhancing the integrity of localization of the multi-robot team. The main contributions of this paper are: - developing a new method of sensors data fusion that tackle the erroneous data issues, - developing a Kullback–Leibler based criterion for the threshold optimization, - Validation with real experimental data from a group of robots. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Considerable work has been carried out using a number of sensing technologies for condition assessment of civil infrastructure. Fewer efforts, however, have been directed for integrating the use of these technologies. This paper presents a newly developed method for automated condition assessment and rating of concrete bridge decks. The method integrates the use of ground-penetrating radar (GPR) and infrared thermography (IR) technologies. It utilizes a data-fusion technique to improve the accuracy of detecting defects and, accordingly, that of condition assessment. In this research, pixel-level image fusion is applied to assess bridge condition using these two technologies. GPR data are displayed as three-dimensional (3D) from 24 scans equally spaced by 0.33 m to interpret a section of a bridge deck surface in Montréal, Canada. The analysis of reflected amplitude waves is used to detect subsurface changed conditions. The GPR data are fused with infrared thermography images using a wavelet transform technique. Four scenarios based on image processing are studied and their application before and after data fusion is assessed in relation to accuracy of the employed fusion process. The concrete deck's condition is assessed based on deteriorated areas that are extracted from the new fused image. Analysis of the results showed that bridge condition assessment can be improved with image fusion and this can enhance the capabilities of inspectors in interpretation of the results obtained. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={Precise, robust, and consistent localization is an important subject in many areas of science such as vision-based control, path planning, and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). To estimate the pose of a platform, sensors such as inertial measurement units (IMUs), global positioning system (GPS), and cameras are commonly employed. Each of these sensors has their strengths and weaknesses. Sensor fusion is a known approach that combines the data measured by different sensors to achieve a more accurate or complete pose estimation and to cope with sensor outages. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3D) pose estimation algorithm is presented for a unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) in an unknown GPS-denied environment. A UAV can be fully localized by three position coordinates and three orientation angles. The proposed algorithm fuses the data from an IMU, a camera, and a two-dimensional (2D) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) using extended Kalman filter (EKF) to achieve accurate localization. Among the employed sensors, LiDAR has not received proper attention in the past; mostly because a two-dimensional (2D) LiDAR can only provide pose estimation in its scanning plane, and thus, it cannot obtain a full pose estimation in a 3D environment. A novel method is introduced in this paper that employs a 2D LiDAR to improve the full 3D pose estimation accuracy acquired from an IMU and a camera, and it is shown that this method can significantly improve the precision of the localization algorithm. The proposed approach is evaluated and justified by simulation and real world experiments. Copyright © 2017 by ASME.},

abstract={The StreetScan pavement-management system (PMS) is introduced. It empowers cities to make more cost-effective road repair decisions. At the heart of the system is a vehicle outfitted with a patented, multimodal sensor array that rapidly collects data for every street in the city. A combination of sensor-specific algorithms and multisensor data fusion are applied to convert the raw data into more actionable condition indices. Decision trees and mathematical models are then applied to determine what repairs are needed and how to prioritize them in the most cost effective manner. Users are able to visualize and interact with the repair suggestions and condition indices through an innovative web-based geographic information system (GIS) application. At less than half the cost, the StreetScan PMS is considerably more affordable than conventional PMSs. This paper validates its effectiveness in the real world by taking a look at two recent applications: (1) a city-wide application in Beverly, Massachusetts and (2) an application to several streets in Boston, Massachusetts. © 2016 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

abstract={The adoption of multi-sensor data fusion techniques is essential to effectively merge and analyze heterogeneous data collected by multiple sensors, pervasively deployed in a smart environment. Existing literature leverages contextual information in the fusion process, to increase the accuracy of inference and hence decision making in a dynamically changing environment. In this paper, we propose a context-aware, self-optimizing, adaptive system for sensor data fusion, based on a three-tier architecture. Heterogeneous data collected by sensors at the lowest tier are combined by a dynamic Bayesian network at the intermediate tier, which also integrates contextual information to refine the inference process. At the highest tier, a self-optimization process dynamically reconfigures the sensory infrastructure, by sampling a subset of sensors in order to minimize energy consumption and maximize inference accuracy. A Bayesian approach allows to deal with the imprecision of sensory measurements, due to environmental noise and possible hardware malfunctions. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with the application scenario of the user activity recognition in an Ambient Intelligence system managing a smart home environment. Experimental results show that the proposed solution outperforms static approaches for context-aware multi-sensor fusion, achieving substantial energy savings whilst maintaining a high degree of inference accuracy. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have emerged as a revolutionary technology in many application domains in health-care, fitness, smart cities, and many other compelling Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Most commercially available systems assume that a single device monitors a plethora of user information. In reality, BSN technology is transitioning to multi-device synchronous measurement environments; fusion of the data from multiple, potentially heterogeneous, sensor sources is therefore becoming a fundamental yet non-trivial task that directly impacts application performance. Nevertheless, only recently researchers have started developing technical solutions for effective fusion of BSN data. To the best of our knowledge, the community is currently lacking a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art techniques on multi-sensor fusion in the area of BSN. This survey discusses clear motivations and advantages of multi-sensor data fusion and particularly focuses on physical activity recognition, aiming at providing a systematic categorization and common comparison framework of the literature, by identifying distinctive properties and parameters affecting data fusion design choices at different levels (data, feature, and decision). The survey also covers data fusion in the domains of emotion recognition and general-health and introduce relevant directions and challenges of future research on multi-sensor fusion in the BSN domain. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In multi-sensor data fusion based on multiple features, the high dimensionality of feature space increases the runtime and computational complexity. The present study proposes a new algorithm based on the combination of random subspace (RS), linear discriminant analysis and sparse regularisation (LDASR), namely RS-LDASR for feature space dimensionality reduction, supervised feature selection, and learning. The use of RSs can effectively solve the problem of high dimensionality and high feature-to-instance ratio. The extraction of multiple features from the images raises the possibility of a correlation between features which reduce classification accuracy. In this study, after the construction of several RSs, supervised feature selection and learning based on LDASR were applied with very high accuracy. Classification and image fusion for remote sensing data analysis were tested by the implementation of feature-based fusion on two pairs of fused synthetic aperture radar and optical data. Four feature matrices were constructed using attribute profiles (APs), multi-APs (MAPs), non-negative matrix factorisation (NMF), and textural features. Support vector machine and rotation forest were applied as the base classifiers. The results show that use of RS-LDASR significantly improved the classification accuracy based on NMF plus texture features and even NMF alone. © 2016, The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={We present a new framework, called multisensor coupled spectral unmixing (MuCSUn), that solves unmixing problems involving a set of multisensor time-series spectral images in order to understand dynamic changes of the surface at a subpixel scale. The proposed methodology couples multiple unmixing problems based on regularization on graphs between the time-series data to obtain robust and stable unmixing solutions beyond data modalities due to different sensor characteristics and the effects of nonoptimal atmospheric correction. Atmospheric normalization and cross calibration of spectral response functions are integrated into the framework as a preprocessing step. The proposed methodology is quantitatively validated using a synthetic data set that includes seasonal and trend changes on the surface and the residuals of nonoptimal atmospheric correction. The experiments on the synthetic data set clearly demonstrate the efficacy of MuCSUn and the importance of the preprocessing step. We further apply our methodology to a real time-series data set composed of 11 Hyperion and 22 Landsat-8 images taken over Fukushima, Japan, from 2011 to 2015. The proposed methodology successfully obtains robust and stable unmixing results and clearly visualizes class-specific changes at a subpixel scale in the considered study area. © 1980-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In real applications, how to measure the uncertain degree of sensor reports before applying sensor data fusion is a big challenge. In this paper, in the frame of Dempster–Shafer evidence theory, a weighted belief entropy based on Deng entropy is proposed to quantify the uncertainty of uncertain information. The weight of the proposed belief entropy is based on the relative scale of a proposition with regard to the frame of discernment (FOD). Compared with some other uncertainty measures in Dempster–Shafer framework, the new measure focuses on the uncertain information represented by not only the mass function, but also the scale of the FOD, which means less information loss in information processing. After that, a new multi-sensor data fusion approach based on the weighted belief entropy is proposed. The rationality and superiority of the new multi-sensor data fusion method is verified according to an experiment on artificial data and an application on fault diagnosis of a motor rotor. © 2017 by the authors.

It is necessary and critical to obtain the most accurate measurements in many industrial applications, or as an example in medical centers which utilize ventilators to help patients breathe. The aim is to demonstrate that by combining data gained from different sensors using Data Fusion, the results are more accurate and reliable compared to single-sensor measurements. To gather all data gained by sensors and transferring them to computer, an interface circuit consisting a microcontroller is put in use and for sampling data we use MATLAB software. Then using Fisher method we estimate the airflow from different data obtained from the sensors. To conclude, we show that the results from data fusion is more reliable and accurate. © 2017 IEEE.},

Often this goal is achieved by exposing the system to a sufficient number of load conditions involving well-controlled values not only of the measurands but also of the disturbances. In this work we show that the calibration effort focused exclusively on the extraction of disturbance-compensated measurand values can be considerably reduced in the case of systems with linear response. The conclusions therefore apply to Hall, piezoresistive stress, and temperature sensors, among others. During the calibration procedure, well-controlled measurand values need indeed to be applied to the system; however, while all disturbance parameters need to be varied during calibration, accurate knowledge of their values is not needed. By making use exclusively of the calibration measurand values and the concurrently extracted sensor signals, it is possible to determine a reduced calibration matrix which ensure the successful extraction of disturbance-compensated measurand values from sensor signals. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated using a six-degree-of freedom linear force-moment microtransducer with redundant sensors. The method may save cost by simpler calibration setups and the time-saving procedure it proposes. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Postural instability is one of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease which can cause falls with possible unpleasant consequences. Two main tests, the Timed Up and Go and the Pull Test, are typically performed by physicians to assess the postural instability of patients. Such tests require on purpose structured laboratory equipped with expensive monitoring systems. Moreover, in the case of Pull test, the validity of the tests can be compromised by the nonstandard backward tug provided to the patient. The solution proposed in this paper consists of a low cost multisensor system and a methodology which allows to implement an objective estimation of the input solicitation as well as the assessment and classification of the user response. Different parameters (10) presented in the literature for the sake of the postural instability evaluation were investigated, in case of Pull Test, with a large set of experiments (59) in order to extract a set of features useful for the classification between stable and unstable behavior. Results obtained demonstrated the feasibility of the methodology proposed. © 2017 IEEE.},

Traditional multi-sensor data fusion can deal with the same type of data effectively. However, as new characteristics emerge in the IoT, interoperable service-oriented technologies are required to share real-world data among heterogeneous devices to integrate and fuse the multi-source heterogeneous IoT data. To address these issues, an architecture that can provide guidance for the development of IoT information fusion is required. We compare features of IoT data and information with an existing wireless sensor network and the Internet, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comparison of this kind. Then, we design a framework for multi-source heterogeneous information fusion in the IoT and use an experimental simulation platform to build an environmental monitoring system to assess the framework. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={The trend towards product miniaturisation and multi-functionality constitutes a driving force for the application of complex surfaces in many fields such as advanced optics. The precision measurement of these surfaces should be carried out at multiple scales, of which process commonly involves several datasets obtained from different sensors. This paper presents a weighted least square based multi-sensor data fusion method for such measurement. The method starts from unifying the coordinate frames of the measured datasets using an intrinsic feature based surface registration method. B-spline surface is used to fit linear surface model to each identified overlapping area of the registered datasets, respectively. By forming a common basis function, the fitted surface models and the corresponding residuals are then combined to construct a weighted least square based data fusion system which is used to generate a fused surface model. An analysis of the uncertainty propagation in data fusion process is also given. Both computer simulation and actual measurement on various freeform surfaces are conducted to verify the validity of proposed method. The results indicate that the proposed method is capable of fusing multi-sensor measured datasets with notable reduction of the measurement uncertainty. © 2016},

In addition to state-of-the-art solutions for recognizing handwriting and speech, we introduce a multilayer architecture for the merger of modalities. Specifically, the Dempster-Shafer theory is used to process the information at the symbol level. This bimodal system is evaluated on real bimodal data, the HAMEX dataset.

abstract={How to achieve reliable and accurate positioning performance using low-cost sensors is one of the main challenges for land vehicles. This paper proposes a novel fusion positioning strategy for land vehicles in GPS-denied environments, which enhances the positioning performance simultaneously from the sensor and methodology levels. It integrates multiple complementary low-cost sensors not only incorporating GPS and microelectromechanical-based inertial measurement unit, but also a "virtual" sensor, i.e., a sliding-mode observer (SMO). The SMO is first synthesized based on nonlinear vehicle dynamics model to estimate vehicle state information robustly. Then, a federated Kalman filter (FKF) is designed to fuse all sensor information, which can easily isolate and accommodate such sensor failures as GPS ones due to its decentralized filtering architecture. Further, a hybrid global estimator (HGE) is constructed by augmenting the FKF with a grey predictor, which has the advantages of dealing with the systems with uncertain or insufficient information. The HGE works in the update mode when there is no GPS failure, whereas it switches to the prediction mode in case of GPS outage to realize accurate and reliable positioning. The experimental results validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed strategy. © 2017 IEEE.},

Flexibility in cables and unmodeled rotation of feeder pulley in the spatial workspace cause unreliability in the encoder data as well as sagging in cables.

In this study, sensor level fusion algorithm is used to integrate and fuse together the camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data. The main application of this method is in the implementation of various control methodologies where more accurate feedback data leads to an improved control performance. It is assumed that the cable mass is negligible and hence it insignificantly contributes to the robot dynamics.

abstract={The combined use of multiple measurement sensors is considered as a promising solution in surface metrology. Such hybrid instruments require sophisticated data fusion process to achieve overall better measurement results. This paper presents a reconstruction-registration integrated data fusion method to address the difficulty in modeling and fusing multiscaled complex data sets. The method decomposes the data sets into different scales by fitting a common surface via reconstruction and registration process so that the modeling and fusion process are also decomposed, and are only performed among the fitting and matching residuals of the data sets. The quality of the fused results is improved based on weighted mean method with the aid of Gaussian process model by taking into account the associated errors of each data set. The validity of the proposed method is verified through a series of comparison tests with existing methods by both computer simulation and actual measurement. It is shown that both enhanced registration accuracy and fusion quality are achieved by the proposed method with acceptable computation cost. The method should improve the metrological performance of the multisensor instruments in measuring complex surfaces. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={A fault diagnosis approach based on multi-sensor data fusion is a promising tool to deal with complicated damage detection problems of mechanical systems. Nevertheless, this approach suffers from two challenges, which are (1) the feature extraction from various types of sensory data and (2) the selection of a suitable fusion level. It is usually difficult to choose an optimal feature or fusion level for a specific fault diagnosis task, and extensive domain expertise and human labor are also highly required during these selections. To address these two challenges, we propose an adaptive multi-sensor data fusion method based on deep convolutional neural networks (DCNN) for fault diagnosis. The proposed method can learn features from raw data and optimize a combination of different fusion levels adaptively to satisfy the requirements of any fault diagnosis task. The proposed method is tested through a planetary gearbox test rig. Handcraft features, manual-selected fusion levels, single sensory data, and two traditional intelligent models, back-propagation neural networks (BPNN) and a support vector machine (SVM), are used as comparisons in the experiment. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to detect the conditions of the planetary gearbox effectively with the best diagnosis accuracy among all comparative methods in the experiment. © 2017 by the authors.

Pairs of nodes cooperatively determine their own relative pose, and by using this knowledge they identify the correlated data related to the common regions of the captured color and depth images. Then, they only transmit the non-redundant information present in these images. As an additional benefit, the scheme also extends the battery life through reduced number of packet transmissions.

abstract={The development and usage of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) quickly increased in the last decades, mainly for military purposes. This technology is also now of high interest in non-military contexts like logistics, environmental studies and different areas of civil protection. While the technology for operating a single UAV is rather mature, additional efforts are still necessary for using UAVs in fleets (or swarms). The Aid to SItuation Management based on MUltimodal, MUltiUAVs, MUltilevel acquisition Techniques (ASIMUT) project which is supported by the European Defence Agency (EDA) aims at investigating and demonstrating dedicated surveillance services based on fleets of UAVs. The aim is to enhance the situation awareness of an operator and to decrease his workload by providing support for the detection of threats based on multi-sensor multi-source data fusion. The operator is also supported by the combination of information delivered by the heterogeneous swarms of UAVs and by additional information extracted from intelligence databases. As a result, a distributed surveillance system increasing detection, high-level data fusion capabilities and UAV autonomy is proposed. © 2016 IEEE.},

Current approaches are aiming for car external solutions like smart infrastructure or Vehicle2X communication to achieve the desired trust into the perception. However this paper is focusing on the enhancement of the internal sensor set and the corresponding Bayesian multi sensor data fusion. This kind of fusion is dependent on sufficient sensor models to weight the measurements correctly.

While Global Positioning System (GPS) is usually used for localization, it has low accuracy caused by signal degradation due to several reasons such as lack of well-positioned satellites, signal obstruction or multipath error. Thus, multi-sensor data fusion has been widely studied to improve vehicle localization. By utilizing the existing techniques for monocular visual odometry and particle filter localization, this paper presents how road information available in OpenStreetMap contributes to accurate and precise vehicle localization by exploiting road probability distribution factor in particle filter implementation. This approach was verified in two datasets with different road features and it has shown better performance compared with the established particle filter localization.

abstract={As ball screw has complex structure and long range of distribution, single signal collected by one sensor is difficult to express its condition fully and accurately. Multi-sensor data fusion usually has a better effect compared with single signal. Multi-sensor data fusion based on neural network(BP) is a commonly used multi-sensor data fusion method, but its application is limited by local optimum problem. Aiming at this problem, a multi-sensor data fusion method based on deep learning for ball screw is proposed in this paper. Deep learning, which consists of unsupervised learning and supervised learning, is the development and evolution of traditional neural network. It can effectively alleviate the optimization difficulty. Parallel superposition on frequency spectra of signals is directly done in the proposed deep learning-based multi-sensor data fusion method, and deep belief networks(DBN) are established by using fused data to adaptively mine available fault characteristics and automatically identify the degradation condition of ball screw. Test is designed to collect vibration signals of ball screw in 7 different degradation conditions by using 5 acceleration sensors installed on different places. The proposed fusion method is applied in identifying the degradation degree of ball screw in the test to demonstrate its efficacy. Finally, the multi-sensor data fusion based on neural network is also applied in degradation degree monitoring. The monitoring accuracy of deep learning-based multi-sensor data fusion is higher compared with that of neural network-based multi-sensor data fusion, which means the proposed method has more superiority. © 2016 IEEE.},

By a general framework, we mean that the proposed method, referred to here as Covariance Extension (CE) Method, is able to directly fuse different dimensions of state vectors as well as constraints without additional processing. For instance, well-known Bar-Shalom Campo and Millman's formulae for the fusion of 2 and N correlated sensors, respectively, cannot properly handle state vectors of unequal dimensions. The proposed CE Method aggregates all the state vectors into a single vector in an extended space and transforms data fusion as a problem of satisfying the constraints among state vectors in the extended space. Specifically, the method orthogonally projects the mean and covariance of the aggregated state vectors on the equality constraint manifold in the extended space. The proposed CE Method is proven to be optimal in the sense of Minimum Mean Square Error (MMSE), while providing computational efficiency over Millman's formula. Simulation results shows the robust nature and effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2017 ACM.},

abstract={During manned long-term missions in orbit, sealed structures have to meet the challenges of the space environment, such as meteoroids and space debris impacts, charged particles radiation, temperature cycling, vacuum environment, etc. Sealed structures and rubber sealing may be damaged by these factors. A sealed module faces the risk of leaks that can affect the pressure inside the module and even threaten the safety of the astronauts. Therefore, when performing leak-proof welding, it is an important precondition to know how to repair the failed structure and how to detect and locate the leak rapidly. General leak monitoring methods were surveyed and analyzed and it was demonstrated that any method, when used alone, can’t be used effectively for rapid detection and location of leaks in a sealed structure. A multi-sensor data fusion method is presented that allows diagnosing the leaks and the leakage rate thus allowing for effective leak detection and location in sealed spacecraft structures. The leak detection and location system consists of two subsystems: pressure leak monitor and meteoroid and space debris impact monitor. These two subsystems work continuously to monitor the spacecraft leakage rate and impact damage, respectively. In addition, an information interface, estimation strategy, and transfer flow of five subsystems were designed. This method is substantiated by a ground experiment to confirm that the sealed structure leak reason, location and leakage rate can be detected accurately and can be applied in welding operations directly. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={When a gear fault is presented, the ensemble empirical decomposition (EEMD) method has been widely used in the detection of gear fault and has given good results. However, under signals from two vibration transducers which are installed in different directions, the vibration data from every sensor becomes necessary to obtain much more precise results. This paper suggests a new feature frequency extraction approach for gear malfunctions diagnosis using the full vector spectrum (FCS) and EEMD method. The approach embodies model building of multi-sensor data fusion and main intrinsic mode functions(IMFs) analysing of merged data from two vibration sensors. By using EEMD the data from single channel can be decomposed into a number of IMFs. To alleviate the diversity problem of EEMD decomposition results occurring in two channels, full vector spectrum (FVS) is introduced. With full vector spectrum, information obtained from each sensor can be merged a piece of vibration evidence in frequency domain, and then we use Hilbert transform to calculate the envelope spectrum of each IMF to evaluate the fault feature frequency. In this work, simulated signal and gear experiment were conducted to validate this strategy. The results have proven that the proposed method can enhance the effectiveness of feature frequency extraction in diagnosing gear faults. © 2017 The Authors.},

Three modules are designed for WHSS: sensor integration module, power supply and power module, and signal integration and network transmission module. Corresponding sensors are chosen for WHSS according to various application requirements. Existing disturbances affect the accuracy and reliability of the judgment about the health feature points, accordingly the anti-interference processing is carried out. WHSS has only integrated multi-sensor without setting powerful data processing unit, so the captured signal is extended to handheld terminals to display and control in accordance with the processing ability of formalities terminal.

abstract={These days, the most important areas of research in many different applications, with different tools, are focused on how to get awareness. One of the serious applications is the awareness of the behavior and activities of patients. The importance is due to the need of ubiquitous medical care for individuals. That the doctor knows the patient's physical condition, sometimes is very important. Of course, there are other important applications for this information. There are a variety of methods and tools for measurement, gathering, and analysis of the physical behaviors and activities' information. One of the most successful tools for this aim are ubiquitous intelligent electronic devices, specifically smartphones, and smart watches. There are many sensors in these devices, some of which can be used to understand the activities of daily living. As an output result, these sensors produce many raw data. Thus, it is needed to process these information and recognize the individual behavior of the output of this processing. In this paper, the basic components of the analysis phase for this process have been proposed.

Local optimal control laws depend on global state estimates and are calculated by each node. In a classical centralized information pattern the global state estimators use measurements data from all nodes. In a decentralized system the global state estimates are computed at each node using local state estimates based on local measurements and values of previous controls, from other nodes. In the paper, contrary to this, the controls are not transmitted between nodes. It leads to nonconventional filtration because the controls from other nodes are treated as random variables for each node. The cost for the additional reduced transmission is an increased filter computation at each node. Copyright ©Silesian University of Technology 2017.},

abstract={The underwater glider has the advantages of low power, long endurance and high accuracy. Micro-Electro-Mechanical- System (MEMS) grade inertial sensors are more suitable for an underwater glider because of their low cost and small size. Models of MEMS sensor noises which include not only the white noises and random walk terms but also the bias instabilities of the sensor noises are analyzed. The integrated navigation system for the underwater glider is composed of a dead reckoning (DR) module, an inertial navigation system (INS) based on MEMS sensors aided by a tri-Axis magnetic sensor. Due to the inherent error characteristics, MEMS grade devices suffer from the non-stationary stochastic sensor errors and nonlinear inertial errors which cannot be well handled by the conventional filter algorithms, this paper proposes extended Kalman filter (EKF) fusing Runge-Kutta (RK4) algorithm (EKF/RK4) which can implement the data fusion of multisensor. The proposed EKF/RK4 can take advantage of the EKF to achieve the optimal estimation of attitude and position and then make better use of the RK4 to further improve the estimation accuracy. In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the EKF/RK4 algorithm is applied to the underwater navigation system designed in our lab and a series of land experiments are performed. The performance of the proposed EKF/RK4 algorithm based on our navigation system is analyzed and compared with the traditional algorithms. The experiment results show that the proposed algorithm is more effective in reducing the attitude and position errors than KF/RK4 and EKF.},

abstract={This paper presents the design and development of a fuzzy logic based multisensor fire detection system and a web-based notification system. Until recently, most consumer grade fire detection systems relied solely on smoke detectors. The protection provided by these has been established to be limited by the type of fire present and the detection technology at use. The problem is further compounded by the lack of adequate alert and notification mechanisms. A typical system relies on the physical presence of a human being to act on the alert. In developing countries, poor planning and addressing negatively affects the fire and rescue crew's response time. To address this problem, a fuzzy logic system was implemented using an Arduino development board with inputs from an MQ2 smoke sensor, a TMP102 temperature sensor, and a DFRobot flame sensor. The output of the detection system is sent over short message service (SMS) using a SIM900 global system for mobile communication (GSM) module to the web-based system and the house owner or caretaker in real-time. With access granted to the web-based system, the fire and rescue crew also get notified in real-time with location information. A comparison between the efficiency of the notification system employed by standard fire detectors and the multisensor remote-based notification approach adopted in this paper showed significant improvements in the form of timely detection, alerting, and response. © 1972-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={At present, the research is still in the primary stage in the process of fault disturbance energy transfer in the multilevel modular converter based high voltage direct current (HVDC-MMC). An urgent problem is how to extract and analyze the fault features hidden in MMC electrical information in further studies on the HVDC system. Aiming at the above, this article analyzes the influence of AC transient disturbance on electrical signals of MMC. At the same time, it is found that the energy distribution of electrical signals in MMC is different for different arms in the same frequency bands after the discrete wavelet packet transformation (DWPT). Renyi wavelet packet energy entropy (RWPEE) and Renyi wavelet packet time entropy (RWPTE) are proposed and applied to AC transient fault feature extraction from electrical signals in MMC. Using the feature extraction results of Renyi wavelet packet entropy (RWPE), a novel recognition method is put forward to recognize AC transient faults using the information fusion technology. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed method is available to recognize transient AC faults.},

abstract={The steady temperature is vital to organ-saving out of body in a hypothermic machine perfusion (HMP) system. A thermostatic control strategy based on multi-sensor data fusion and fuzzy-PID method is proposed in this paper to improve the accuracy. Firstly, the basic frame of HMP system and the installation of sensors are expounded. Then the data fusion based on modified Bayes estimation is carried out to weaken the possible measurement error, resulting from the sensor faults and noise interference. Specially, the better error-recovery ability is proved in the cascaded Bayes algorithm. Secondly, the fuzzy and the fuzzy-PID (Proportion Integration Differentiation) controller are adopted respectively according to the difference of temperature-deviation. Here the former is designed to offer the control variation of compressor needed while the latter is to gain three control coefficients of PID algorithm. The dynamic and static tests indicate that the thermostatic control result meets the need of patients although it is also affected by some extra factors, such as the external temperature, flow speed of solution and working modes. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Attackers often attempt to move laterally from host to host, infecting them until an overall goal is achieved. One possible defense against this strategy is to detect such coordinated and sequential actions by fusing data from multiple sources. In this paper, we propose a framework for distributed data fusion that specifies the communication architecture and data transformation functions. Then, we use this framework to specify an approach for lateral movement detection that uses host-level process communication graphs to infer network connection causations. The connection causations are then aggregated into system-wide host-communication graphs that expose possible lateral movement in the system. In order to provide a balance between the resource usage and the robustness of the fusion architecture, we propose a multilevel fusion hierarchy that uses different clustering techniques. We evaluate the scalability of the hierarchical fusion scheme in terms of storage overhead, number of message updates sent, fairness of resource sharing among clusters, and quality of local graphs. Finally, we implement a host-level monitor prototype to collect connection causations, and evaluate its overhead. The results show that our approach provides an effective method to detect lateral movement between hosts, and can be implemented with acceptable overhead. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this paper, by taking the linear and nonlinear equality state constraints into the EKF-based fusion framework with the method of perfect measurement and estimate projection, the performance of fusion results can be greatly improved. The modeling process is introduced and two simulation cases have been conducted, which show the positioning accuracy of the mobile robot can be significantly improved after the introduction of the equivalent constraint.

A simulator for the TAN system using a low resolution Arctic bathymetric map is developed to study the capability to reduce/bound the positioning error growth due to the Dead Reckoning (DR) drift over time. Bathymetric measurements are obtained using a low sample rated single beam echo sounder and a Jittered Bootsrap Particle Filter (JBPF) is used for the multi-sensor data fusion problem. Sensitivity analysis of JBPF has been performed for a range of values of number of particles, jittering variances and measurement frequencies and a discussion over the results is given. Results from the simulation demonstrate that JBPF is capable of providing a robust and accurate solution to the localization problem provided that the AUV follows a trajectory with a sufficiently variant terrain.

abstract={Automatic registration of multisensor data, for example, imagery and Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), is a basic step in data fusion in the field of geospatial information processing. Mutual information (MI) has recently attracted research attention as a statistical similarity measure for intensity-based registration of multisensor images in the related fields of computer vision and remote sensing. Since MI-based registration methods rely on joint probability density functions (pdfs) for the data sets, errors in pdf estimation can affect the MI value, causing registration failure due to the presence of nonmonotonic surfaces of similarity measure. The quality of the estimated pdf is highly dependent upon both the bin size and the smoothing technique used in the pdf estimation procedure. The lack of a general approach to assign an appropriate bin size value for the pdf of multisensor data reduces both the level of automation and the robustness of the registration. In this paper, a novel bin size selection approach is proposed to improve registration reliability. The proposed method determines the best (uniform or variable) bin size for the pdf estimation via an analysis of the relationship between the similarity measure values of the data and the adopted geometric transformation. This highlights the role of the component of MI sensitive to the transformation, rather than the MI component that is unrelated to the transformation, such as noise. The performance of the proposed method for the registration of aerial imagery to LiDAR point clouds is investigated, and experimental results are compared with those achieved through a feature-based registration method. © 2016 IEEE.},

Experimental and simulation results have shown not only a reduced positioning error in terms of localization effectiveness but also a superior performance in several challenging industrial operational conditions.

abstract={Multisensor data fusion is an emerging technology applied to military areas such as automated target recognition, battlefield surveillance, guidance and control of autonomous vehicles and also to non-military applications such as monitoring of complex machinery, medical diagnosis, and smart buildings. Techniques for multisensor data fusion include artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, statistical estimation, and other areas. In this work, we have used multisensor data fusion for navigation and to control an autonomous vehicle. Various sensors such as GPS, digital camera, digital compass, laser scanner and ultrasound sensor have been used to gather data from structured surroundings. This data is then preprocessed and selectively fused to make reliable decisions. The sensors are interfaced with an onboard vehicle controller and the vehicle navigates a certain path on the basis of a robust multisensory data fusion algorithm. © 2016 IEEE.},

However, many challenges are addressed in WBSNs such as limited energy resources, early detection of emergencies and fusion of large amount of heterogeneous data in order to take decisions. In this paper, we propose a multisensor data fusion approach enabling one to determine the patient risk level based on vital signs scores. Consequently, a corresponding decision is taken routinely and each time an emergency is detected. This approach is based on early warning score systems, a fuzzy inference system and a technique determining the score of a vital sign given its past and current value.

However, it is difficult for multisensor to precisely acquire information at the same moment and result in data fusion error. Thus, the measurement precision is severely degraded. To solve the problem, a multisensor time synchronization error modeling and compensation method is proposed. Based on the component and operation principles of distributed POS, the time synchronization mechanism is analyzed. Multisensor time synchronization error models that include time delay error, random error, and time-varying error are established. A time synchronization error compensation method of the distributed POS is proposed. The experiment results show that the proposed method can accurately calibrate and compensate for the time synchronization error, and improve the measurement precision of the distributed POS. It verified the validity of the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={We address the problem of accurately locating buried utility segments by fusing data from multiple sensors using a novel Marching-Cross-Section (MCS) algorithm. Five types of sensors are used in this work: Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR), Passive Magnetic Fields (PMF), Magnetic Gradiometer (MG), Low Frequency Electromagnetic Fields (LFEM) and Vibro-Acoustics (VA). As part of the MCS algorithm, a novel formulation of the extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is proposed for marching existing utility tracks from a scan cross-section (scs) to the next one; novel rules for initializing utilities based on hypothesized detections on the first scs and for associating predicted utility tracks with hypothesized detections in the following scss are introduced. Algorithms are proposed for generating virtual scan lines based on given hypothesized detections when different sensors do not share common scan lines, or when only the coordinates of the hypothesized detections are provided without any information of the actual survey scan lines. The performance of the proposed system is evaluated with both synthetic data and real data. The experimental results in this work demonstrate that the proposed MCS algorithm can locate multiple buried utility segments simultaneously, including both straight and curved utilities, and can separate intersecting segments. By using the probabilities of a hypothesized detection being a pipe or a cable together with its 3D coordinates, the MCS algorithm is able to discriminate a pipe and a cable close to each other. The MCS algorithm can be used for both post-and on-site processing. When it is used on site, the detected tracks on the current scs can help to determine the location and direction of the next scan line. The proposed “multi-utility multi-sensor” system has no limit to the number of buried utilities or the number of sensors, and the more sensor data used, the more buried utility segments can be detected with more accurate location and orientation. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Modern Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) employ a variety of sensors and multi-sensor data fusion techniques to provide advanced functionalities and trusted autonomy in a wide range of mission-essential and safety-critical tasks. In particular, Navigation and Guidance Systems (NGS) for small RPAS require a typical combination of lightweight, compact and inexpensive sensors to satisfy the Required Navigation Performance (RNP) in all flight phases. In this paper, the synergies attainable by the combination of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), Micro-Electromechanical System based Inertial Measurement Unit (MEMS-IMU) and Vision-Based Navigation (VBN) sensors are explored. In case of VBN, an appearance-based navigation technique is adopted and feature extraction/optical flow methods are employed to estimate the navigation parameters during precision approach and landing phases. A key novelty of the proposed approach is the employment of Aircraft Dynamics Models (ADM) augmentation to compensate for the shortcomings of VBN and MEMS-IMU sensors in high-dynamics attitude determination tasks. To obtain the best estimates of Position, Velocity and Attitude (PVA), different sensor combinations are analysed and dynamic Boolean Decision Logics (BDL) are implemented for data selection before the centralised data fusion is accomplished. Various alternatives for data fusion are investigated including a traditional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and a more advanced Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). A novel hybrid controller employing fuzzy logic and Proportional–Integral–Derivative (PID) techniques is implemented to provide effective stabilisation and control of pitch and roll angles. After introducing the key mathematical models describing the three NGS architectures: EKF based VBN-IMU-GNSS (VIG) and VBN-IMU-GNSS-ADM (VIGA) and UKF based Enhanced VIGA (EVIGA), the system performances are compared in a small RPAS integration scheme (i.e., AEROSONDE RPAS platform) exploring a representative cross-section of the aircraft operational flight envelope. A dedicated ADM processor (i.e., a local pre-filter) is adopted in the EVIGA architecture to account for the RPAS manoeuvring envelope in different flight phases (assisted by a manoeuvre identification algorithm), in order to extend the ADM validity time across all segments of the RPAS trajectory. Simulation results show that the VIG, VIGA and EVIGA systems are compliant with ICAO requirements for precision approach down to CAT-II. In all other flight phases, the VIGA system shows improvement in PVA data output with respect to the VIG system. The EVIGA system shows the best performance in terms of attitude data accuracy and a significant extension of the ADM validity time is achieved in this configuration. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS},

Second, in the final particle filter module based on the adaptive weight, a complete likelihood function was structured. Meanwhile, by Euclidean distance and the accuracy factor reflecting the statistic properties of the measured noise, the distribution of the adaptive weight was adjusted to attain a more accurate estimate.

abstract={In this paper, a distributed cubature Gaussian mixture filter (DCGMF) based on an iterative diffusion strategy (DCGMF-ID) is proposed for multisensor estimation and information fusion. The uncertainties are represented as Gaussian mixtures at each sensor node. A high-degree cubature Kalman filter provides accurate estimation of each Gaussian mixture component. An iterative diffusion scheme is utilized to fuse the mean and covariance of each Gaussian component obtained from each sensor node. The DCGMF-ID extends the conventional diffusion-based fusion strategy by using multiple iterative information exchanges among neighboring sensor nodes. The convergence property of the iterative diffusion is analyzed. In addition, it is shown that the convergence of the iterative diffusion can be interpreted from the information-theoretic perspective as minimization of the Kullback-Leibler divergence. The performance of the DCGMF-ID is compared with the DCGMF based on the average consensus (DCGMF-AC) and the DCGMF based on the iterative covariance intersection (DCGMF-ICI) via a maneuvering target-tracking problem using multiple sensors. The simulation results show that the DCGMF-ID has better performance than the DCGMF based on noniterative diffusion, which validates the benefit of iterative information exchanges. In addition, the DCGMF-ID outperforms the DCGMF-ICI and DCGMF-AC when the number of iterations is limited. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In industrial processes a vast variety of different sensors is increasingly used to measure and control processes, machines, and logistics. One way to handle the resulting large amount of data created by hundreds or even thousands of different sensors in an application is to employ information fusion systems. Information fusion systems, e.g. for condition monitoring, combine different sources of information, like sensors, to generate the state of a complex system. The result of such an information fusion process is regarded as a health indicator of a complex system. Therefore, information fusion approaches are applied to, e.g., automatically inform one about a reduction in production quality, or detect possibly dangerous situations. Considering the importance of sensors in the previously described information fusion systems and in industrial processes in general, a defective sensor has several negative consequences. It may lead to machine failure, e.g. when wear and tear of a machine is not detected sufficiently in advance. In this contribution we present a method to detect faulty sensors by computing the consistency between sensor values. The proposed sensor defect detection algorithm exemplarily utilises the structure of a multilayered group-based sensor fusion algorithm. Defect detection results of the proposed method for different test cases and the method's capability to detect a number of typical sensor defects are shown. © 2016 The Author(s).},

abstract={Scientific studies have demonstrated that an atypical respiratory rate (RR) is frequently one of the earliest and major indicators of physiological distress. However, it is also described in the literature as 'the neglected vital parameter', mainly due to shortcomings of clinical available monitoring techniques, which require attachment of sensors to the patient's body. The current paper introduces a novel approach that uses multisensor data fusion for an enhanced RR estimation in thermal videos. It considers not only the temperature variation around nostrils and mouth, but the upward and downward movement of both shoulders. In order to analyze the performance of our approach, two experiments were carried out on five healthy candidates. While during phase A, the subjects breathed normally, during phase B they simulated different breathing patterns. Thoracic effort was the gold standard elected to validate our algorithm. Our results show an excellent agreement between infrared thermography (IRT) and ground truth. While in phase A a mean correlation of 0.983 and a root-mean-square error of 0.240 bpm (breaths per minute) was obtained, in phase B they hovered around 0.995 and 0.890 bpm, respectively. In sum, IRT may be a promising clinical alternative to conventional sensors. Additionally, multisensor data fusion contributes to an enhancement of RR estimation and robustness. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Target data association is one of the key procedures of multi-sensor data fusion and many algorithms have been developed to solve the traditional association problem. However, performance of traditional methods is degraded in communication constrained environment. In this paper, an approach is proposed to solve the problem of target data association in communication constrained environment. In the algorithm, we extract, quantify and compress the reference topology feature in order to complete the association with lower amount of data than traditional methods. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve higher correct rate in target data association than traditional methods with the same data volume. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={To solve the multi-target joint tracking and classification under clutter and miss detection, the model-class-matched probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter is proposed and combined with the transferable belief model (TBM) framework of multiple sensors, and it is recursively implemented by multiple kinematic radars and particle filtering. In our algorithm, the priori information of aircraft is estimated to replace the attribute sensor. At the prediction stage, the particles of the PHD filter are matched by model and class; the particle weights are updated after the sensors receive the measurement information; then, the targets' posterior state-model-class distribution is got by the corresponding weights of the particles; the targets' state and class can be obtained simultaneously by these PHD filters; finally, by integrating TBM and the track particle labeling algorithm, the fusion result of multiple sensors is acquired. Simulations indicate that the performance of the proposed model-class-matched PHD filter is much better than that of the traditional PHD filter, and in the meantime the TBM framework of multiple sensors also improves the performance the proposed algorithm. © 2016, Editorial Office of Systems Engineering and Electronics.

abstract={The traffic safety of a railway bridge is generally evaluated by levels of structural responses such as acceleration, vertical displacement, and deck twist. Whereas acceleration can be readily measured in general, acquiring displacement and twist responses in field testing is often a challenging task due to lack of appropriate sensors. As most existing displacement transducers are designed to measure at a single location, the deck twist which is calculated from four displacements requires costly and labor-intensive sensor instrumentation. To effectively address the issue, this study proposes an integral strategy for the traffic safety evaluation of railway bridges using multisensor data. The proposed approach provides a formulation to estimate the dense displacement necessary for obtaining twist responses using acceleration and strain measurements. Wireless sensors are adopted because of their intrinsic advantages in multimetric sensing of heterogeneous data, convenient sensor instrumentation, and high-fidelity time-synchronized data acquisition. The proposed approach for dense displacement estimation is numerically and experimentally validated using beam models. Subsequently, a full-scale experiment on a railway bridge is conducted to evaluate the traffic safety for high-speed trains at three different speeds of 280 km/h, 300 km/h, and 400 km/h. The acceleration, vertical displacement, and twist are obtained and compared with design limits to determine the traffic safety of the railway bridge. © 2016 Computer-Aided Civil and Infrastructure Engineering},

Challenges arise in Multi Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF) due to sensor uncertainty, multiple occluding targets and clutter by changing weather conditions. The proposed architecture address the problem by fusing information cooperatively from Laser scanner and monocular camera for robust detection of scene objects in the vehicle environment. The Fusion steps in the proposed method involve the application of the M-estimator SAmple Consensus (MSAC) algorithm for ground plane removal and density based clustering of laser data. Then the filtered laser objects are projected on the image plane and the corresponding region of interest (ROI) is extracted to localize the potential targets.

abstract={For the multisensor linear stochastic descriptor system, the information fusion full-order descriptor Kalman filters are presented, which are different from the reduced-order Kalman filtering algorithms and can improve filtering accuracy. The centralized fusion full-order descriptor Kalman filter can obtain the globally optimal filter, by extending all measurement information. The weighted measurement fusion full-order descriptor Kalman filter also has global optimality and has less computational burden, based on the least square method. The state fusion and sequential covariance intersection full-order descriptor Kalman filters yield the suboptimal filters. The sequential covariance intersection full-order descriptor Kalman filter avoids computing the cross-variance of local full-order Kalman filters and can reduce the computational burden. The accuracy of the centralized fusion and the weighted measurement fusion full-order Kalman filter is higher than that of state fusion and the sequential covariance intersection fusion full-order Kalman filter, and the accuracy of these algorithms are all higher than that of local full-order Kalman filters.

abstract={To deal with nonlinear challenges on vehicle dynamics state estimation, the eight-DOF(degree of freedom) nonlinear vehicle dynamics state estimation system, including longitudinal, lateral, yaw, and roll motions was constructed by introducing a nonlinear dynamics Dugoff tire model. Based on multi-sensor data fusion, the nonlinear observer with square root cubature Kalman filter was designed to estimate some key parameters, such as lateral tire-road forces and vehicle sideslip angle. Then the co-simulation platform with Simulink-Carsim for the estimated system of distributed drive electric vehicles was built in Matlab/Simulink environment. Simulations for double lane change manoeuvre were carried out to evaluate the feasibility and the effectiveness of the observer. The results show that the observed values with traditional extended Kalman filter state observer deviate from the real values of the vehicle running state when vehicles deliver high lateral acceleration, while the nonlinear observer with the proposed square root cubature Kalman filter has smooth results and reflects the real-time nonlinear vehicle dynamics state during double lane change manoeuvre. And it possesses smaller observer errors and higher observation precision. © 2016, Editorial Department of Journal of Southeast University. All right reserved.},

Considering the precision error of sensor and the abnormalities of measured data, every water quality data measured by sensor was represented by interval number. By calculating the distance between the water quality data and the features of each water quality class, the interval evidence of water quality class was acquired. According to the interval evidence combining rule, a comprehensive interval evidence was obtained by combining the interval evidence of each sensor. Finally, the water quality class was determined based on the comprehensive interval evidence by the decision rule. Experiments show that the proposed method can evaluate water quality class more accurately from the uncertain water quality data. © 2016, Editorial Board of Journal on Communications.

In particular, a novel multisensor data-fusion approach, combining data from an accelerometer and a gyroscope, is presented. Apart from alert management, the information provided by this system is useful to track the evolution of the user pathology, also during rehabilitation tasks. Results obtained during tests with users demonstrate suitable performances of the adopted paradigm, in terms of sensitivity and specificity, in performing falls and ADL classification tasks.

abstract={The objective of this paper is to monitor complex process dynamics manifest in multivariate (multidimensional) time series data using a spectral (algebraic) graph theoretic approach. We test the hypothesis that the spectral graph-based topological invariants detect incipient process drifts earlier [lower average run length (ARL)] and with higher fidelity (consistency of detection) when compared with the conventional statistics-based approaches. The presented approach maps a multidimensional sensor data stream XNxd (visualize N as time and d as the number of sensors) as an unweighted and undirected network graph G(V,E), indexed by its vertices V and edges E, i.e., X |→ G(V,E). The rationale is that the graph-based topological invariants are surrogate representatives of the system state. We compare the monitoring performance of spectral graph theoretic invariants with conventional statistical features in an exponentially weighted moving average control chart setting. The practical utility of the approach is substantiated in the context of process monitoring in two advanced manufacturing scenarios, namely, ultraprecision machining (UPM) and semiconductor chemical mechanical planarization. These studies corroborate the hypothesis that graph theoretic invariants, when used as monitoring statistics, lead to lower ARL and more consistent detections in contrast to conventional statistical features. For instance, in the UPM case, the fault detection delay using graph theoretic invariants is less than 160 ms, compared with over 8 s of delay with statistical features. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, a fusing approach of a 3D sensor and a camera are used to improve the reliability of pedestrian detection. The proposed pedestrian detecting system adopts DBSCAN to cluster 3D points and projects the candidate clusters onto images as region of interest (ROI). Those ROIs are detected by HOG (histograms of oriented gradients) pedestrian detector. Because the DBSCAN groups together 3D points and rejects outlier points correctly, the proposed system has a low false detection rate. The performance is also improved since the proposed system only detects the ROI instead of the whole color image. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are core components of the Internet of Things paradigm. By applying techniques such as sensor virtualization, the wireless sensor network infrastructure can be shared by a set of applications. On such scenario, the massive amount of data produced by the widely spread sensors produces a value-added information for the end user. By sharing the same infrastructure with multiple users, the set of applications in execution may change quickly, according to the users' necessity. In this case, the application requirements (for instance, data intervals or the potential events of interest) may not be known a priori. In this work, we aim to provide a solution to properly integrate data from multiple applications without the knowledge about specific application requirements, and unconver useful information from such data. We propose Hephaestus, an entropic information fusion algorithm, which uses Mean, Kurtosis and Skewness to apply a heuristics that divides the dataset into multiple features, for multiple applications.

abstract={Multi-sensor data fusion using Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) is a promising technique for improving the performance of positioning systems. However, the performance of conventional sensor fusion algorithms based on the Kalman Filter (KF) is compromised in indoor environments due to non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation. In this paper, we propose a semi-real time tracking algorithm which uses a fixed lag smoother for sensor fusion and achieves high accuracy in NLOS environments. The computational complexity of the algorithm is taken into consideration and is reduced by decreasing the operating rate of the smoother. The performance of the proposed algorithm is validated experimentally using a real indoor positioning platform. It is shown that the 90th percentile positioning error for a pedestrian is reduced by 42% using the proposed semi-real time tracking algorithm with 10 s lag, compared with using a KF-based real time tracking algorithm. © 2016 ISIF.},

A single, low-cost gyroscopic unit and three independent compasses are used to acquire data onboard the vehicle. The gyroscope data, prone to sporadic bias drifts, are fused individually with readings from each of the compasses via a weighted interval Kalman filter. Unlike the standard Kalman filter, the weighted interval Kalman filter is able to provide a robust heading estimate even when subject to such gyroscope bias drifts. The three ensuing weighted interval Kalman filter estimates of the vehicle's heading are then fused via a fuzzy logic algorithm designed to provide an accurate heading estimate even when two of the three compasses develop a fault at any time. Simulations and real-time trials demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. © IMechE 2015.},

abstract={Future driver assistance systems will rely heavily on fusion systems and an exact knowledge of the static environment. Several aspects like driving path detection, parking assistants, emergency braking and trajectory planning need the knowledge about non-moving objects in the surroundings of the vehicle. In order to build robust maps of the environment, several possibly conflicting sensor readings must be combined. However, an increased number of sensors and an increased number of driver assistance functions lead to difficulties on integration in the fusion system. Different interfaces must be supported, since sensors provide their data in special formats and functions require each other aspects of the environment. This difficulty has been relaxed by introducing the Fences-architecture and homogeneous interfaces. The architecture leads to several useful properties. This contribution deals with a particular property, the independence of the fusion subsystem from all other subsystems. This property states, that driver assistance functions are executable without modifications, in case the mapping technique is changed or even removed. The property is demonstrated by implementing two different mapping strategies. The environment models created by these strategies as well as an environment model created by a laser scanner are afterwards used to execute a road boundary extractor, which is readily introduced. © 2016 ISIF.},

abstract={Sensor node localization in mobile ad-hoc sensor networks is a challenging problem. Often, the anchor nodes tend to line up in a linear fashion in a mobile sensor network when nodes are deployed in an ad-hoc manner. This paper discusses novel node localization methods under the conditions of collinear ambiguity of the anchors. Additionally, the work presented herein also describes a methodology to fuse data available from multiple sensors for improved localization performance under conditions of collinear ambiguity. In this context, data is first acquired from multiple sensors sensing different modalities. The data acquired from each sensor is used to compute attenuation models for each sensor. Subsequently, a combined multi-sensor attenuation model is developed. The fusion methodology uses a joint error optimization approach on the multi-sensor data. The distance between each sensor node and anchor is itself computed using the differential power principle. These distances are used in the localization of sensor nodes under the condition of collinear ambiguity of anchors. Localization error analysis is also carried out in indoor conditions and compared with the Cramer-Rao lower bound. Experimental results on node localization using simulations and real field deployments indicate reasonable improvements in terms of localization accuracy when compared to methods likes MLAR and MGLR. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Even though video data is a strong cue for motion analysis, tracking artifacts occur frequently due to ambiguities in the images, rapid motions, occlusions or noise. As a complementary data source, inertial sensors allow for accurate estimation of limb orientations even under fast motions. However, accurate position information cannot be obtained in continuous operation. Therefore, we propose a hybrid tracker that combines video with a small number of inertial units to compensate for the drawbacks of each sensor type: on the one hand, we obtain drift-free and accurate position information from video data and, on the other hand, we obtain accurate limb orientations and good performance under fast motions from inertial sensors. In several experiments we demonstrate the increased performance and stability of our human motion tracker. © 1979-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Robust multitarget, multisensor fusion algorithms rely on optimal or near-optimal assignment algorithms at their core. Greedy and semi-greedy search algorithms represent a fast and effective solution to multi-dimensional assignment problems, at the cost of often producing sub-optimal results in challenging cases. The Adaptive Semi-Greedy Search (ASGS) presented here is an improvement on older semi-greedy search methods, and is more likely to find the optimal solution without sacrificing computational speed. ASGS outperforms Semi Greedy Track Selection (SGTS) in a wide range of statistical tests, where it was consistently more likely to find the optimal solution to 6 dimensional assignment problems, as if the RMS measurement error had been reduced by 25%. The two algorithms are also compared in several challenging multitarget, multisensor tracking scenarios, including maneuvering formations and crossing targets, where a Multiple Hypothesis Tracker (MHT) using the ASGS significantly reduces the RMS position error of the tracks (p < 0.001 for each scenario). The ASGS effectively increases the range of scenarios in which semi-greedy assignment algorithms can be reliably employed, especially valuable for real time applications with large number of targets and sensors. © 2016 ISIF.},

abstract={New technologies in lighting enable the design of illumination systems that autonomously meet the needs of occupants. In recent years, lighting design for both commercial and residential spaces has advanced beyond task performance, to a broader range of occupant needs including economic, energy and environmental constraints, architectural integration, human health, productivity, interpersonal communication, and aesthetic quality. Such systems require distributed sensing and control systems with sensory feedback to detect the lighting conditions in the space. Occupancy sensing and activity recognition are core components of this distributed sensor-based control system, and multisensor fusion of integrated sensors is viewed as a key attribute. This paper describes an expanded view of multisensor technologies, signal processing and pattern recognition algorithms that are being developed and evaluated for occupancy detection and activity recognition. This paper presents a multisensor testbed system that incorporates a sparse array of time-of-flight range sensors with pattern recognition algorithms for geometric form and motion detection of human occupants. Three levels of analysis are implemented: (1) Occupant detection and tracking, (2) Occupant pose classification (sitting, standing, and walking), (3) Occupant activity sequence recognition. These algorithms are dependent on statistical training of human pose and motion and implemented with a Bayesian formulation for detection, classification, and recognition. Evaluation of resulting performance in the testbed conference room demonstrates pose and activity recognition accuracy of greater than 97% for single occupants. © 2016 ISIF.},

The results indicate that the OpenCL IA total-path consistency algorithm, executed on a GP-GPU in parallel, should be preferred for temporal constraint satisfaction problems where the network is more likely to be consistent. Then for consistent networks this parallel algorithm can provide execution time speed-up between two and three times, within the tested limits, that of the serial algorithm. We present suggestions as to constraints to the OpenCL IA total-path consistency algorithm. © 2016 ISIF.},

We test the algorithm on a multi-target tracking problem and compared to other contemporary approaches such as the bootstrap particle filter and the auxiliary particle filter (APF). Based on two scenarios, the proposed algorithm is administrated to have a significant increase in accuracy. © 2016 ISIF.},

abstract={Abstract High correlation among the neighboring pixels, both spectrally and spatially in a multispectral image makes it indispensable to use relevant data transformation approaches, before performing image fusion. The principal component analysis (PCA) method has been a popular choice for the spectral transformation. To propose a new consistent data transformation method in spatial domain, this paper applies the PCA transform to the spatial information of the neighboring pixels. Owing to the fact that the coefficients of PCA are obtained from statistical properties of data, they are adaptive and robust. Then, a new hybrid algorithm is proposed combining the spectral PCA and spatial PCA methods, by an optimal filter to make the synthesized result more similar to what the corresponding multisensors would observe at the high-resolution level. The evaluation of the pan-sharpened images, using global validation indexes, reveals that the proposed approach improves the fusion quality compared with six state of the art fusion methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Electronic payment systems have always represented an attractive target for cyber criminals.

This service allows to perform electronic payments across the Euro zone as simple as domestic payments currently are. This schema facilitates the access to new markets by enterprises and reduces the overall cost to move capitals in Europe, but the other side of the coin is that it is the only financial system that has recorded an increase in the number of frauds, as highlighted by European Central Bank in a report dated 2015. In this paper SDD service attack patterns are analysed and a SDD fraud detection system based on multi-sensor data fusion is presented. Specifically, the Dempster-Shafer Theory is used in the proposed system to correlate security-relevant data from multiple information sources in order to detect anomalous behaviours that could be the evidence of an ongoing SDD fraud. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={A proposed framework using spectral and spatial information is introduced for neural net multisensor data fusion. This consists of a set of independent-sensor neural nets, one for each sensor (type of data), coupled to a fusion net. The neural net of each sensor is trained from a representative data set of the particular sensor to map to a hypothesis space output. The decision outputs from the sensor nets are used to train the fusion net to an overall decision. During the initial processing, three-dimensional (3-D) point cloud data (PCD) are segmented using a multidimensional mean-shift algorithm into clustered objects. Concurrently, multiband spectral imagery data (multispectral or hyperspectral) are spectrally segmented by the stochastic expectation-maximization into a cluster map containing (spectral-based) pixel classes. For the proposed sensor fusion, spatial detections and spectral detections complement each other. They are fused into final detections by a cascaded neural network, which consists of two levels of neural nets. The success of the approach in utilizing sensor synergism for an enhanced classification is demonstrated for the specific case of classifying hyperspectral imagery and PCD extracted from LIDAR, obtained from an airborne data collection over the campus of University of Southern Mississippi, Gulfport, Mississippi. © The Authors.},

abstract={Performance of the Kalman filter (KF) is degraded when dealing with nonlinear dynamic systems. For a kind of nonlinear biomechatronics system, a fifth-degree ensemble iterated cubature square-root information filter (EsFICIF), which can effectively improve estimation performance, is proposed by combing many estimation schemes. Moreover, the associated multisensor fusion is deeply studied based on this proposed nonlinear filter in this paper. That is, four classic nonlinear fusion methods, which include augmented measurements fusion, weighted measurements fusion, sequential filtering fusion, and distributed filtering fusion, are compared on estimation performance. The motivation of this paper is to extend the work on estimation performance comparison of nonlinear fusion methods based on the conventional extended KF and to validate some basic conclusions existed in the traditional linear data fusion theory based on the proposed EsFICIF. The estimation accuracies of the four nonlinear fusion methods are compared and the exchanging property of measurements update order is also discussed. It is observed that, when the measurement properties are identical, the estimation accuracies of augmented measurements fusion, weighted measurements fusion, and distributed feedback fusion are equivalent, while the sequential filtering fusion does not hold. Furthermore, the exchanging property of the measurements update order of the sequential filtering fusion can no longer be guaranteed. These results further show some basic conclusions existed in linear fusion theory are no longer valid for nonlinear systems and the conclusions based on the EKF are still available for more complex nonlinear filters. Finally, numerical examples are provided to validate the results given in this paper. © 2013 IEEE.},

For example, is it possible to improve the performance of traffic state estimation using incomplete data? In this article, an incomplete traffic data fusing method is proposed to estimate traffic state accurately. It improves missing data estimation by extracting data correlations and applying incomplete data fusion, implementing the two approaches in parallel. The main research focus is on extracting the inherent spatio-temporal correlations of traffic states data from road segments based on a multiple linear regression (MLR) model. Computational experiments for accuracy and efficiency demonstrate that this method can use data correlations to implement accurate and real-time traffic state estimation.

abstract={Information fusion is a very important technology which can use multisensor network data to get a better performance than single one; therefore, it is widely used in the filed of target recognition, target tracking, automatic control, decision making and so on. However, because of noise and interference, sometimes the sensors may obtain erroneous, inaccurate or heterogeneous data, which will produce the conflict information among different sensors and get the wrong result after information fusion. In this paper, based on the Dempster–Shafer (D–S) theory, we introduce how to set up the model of multisensor network information fusion. And then, we discuss the problem of conflict information fusion in the framework of evidence and several improved methods are introduced. Finally, based on Mahalanobis distance, an improved solution method is presented. The numerical simulation results prove that this new improved method can get the same result as traditional methods, beyond which it can make a reasonable decision with high conflict information. Therefore, this new improved method can be used in the filed of high noise and interference. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Maintaining and improving the quality of life in ageing populations is a necessity. Hence, distant patient monitoring is a solution providing constant surveillance of vital signs and the detection of emergencies when they occur. In the past few years, wireless body sensor networks (WBSNs) emerged as a low cost solution for healthcare applications. In WBSNs, biosensors collect periodically physiological measures and send them to the coordinator where the data fusion process takes place. However, processing the huge amount of data captured by the limited lifetime biosensors and taking the right decisions when there is an emergency are major challenges in WBSNs. In this paper, we introduce a data fusion model using a decision matrix, an early warning score system and fuzzy set theory. We propose an algorithm at the coordinator level of the WBSN, aiming to take the appropriate decision when an emergency is detected. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={The specific capabilities of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), such as fast deployment and flexibility, together with the low cost solutions that can be achieved, bring new opportunities for an all-new range of applications, far from the typical scenarios of low requirements and high redundancy. Some of these new scenarios involve the assurance of predefined performance goals. To guarantee that these goals are achieved, a careful constant monitoring must exist. However, this monitoring depletes nodes energy (especially in middle nodes that have to retransmit the information to the sink), increases interference between nodes and causes an overhead in the used bandwidth, a foreseeable result if measuring performance of a large multilevel WSN. In the protocol to be presented, data fusion is used to enhance the benefits of continuous monitoring while minimizing its implied overhead, using the specific characteristics of WSNs in its favor. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper, Aircraft Dynamics Model (ADM) augmentation for Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) navigation and guidance is presented. This approach provides additional information suitable to compensate for the shortcomings of vision based navigation sensors and Micro-Electromechanical System Inertial Measurement Unit (MEMS-IMU) sensors for attitude determination tasks. The ADM virtual sensor is essentially a knowledge-based module and is used to augment the navigation state vector by predicting RPAS flight dynamics (aircraft trajectory and attitude motion). The ADM employs a rigid body 6-Degree of Freedom (6-DoF) model and is implemented in integrated multi-sensor data fusion architectures. The integration is accomplished with an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). After introducing the key mathematical models describing the 6-DoF ADM, the sensor and integrated system performance are compared in a small RPAS integration scheme (i.e., AEROSONDE RPAS platform) exploring a representative cross-section of the aircraft operational flight envelope and a preliminary sensitivity analysis is performed. In addition to a centralised filter, a dedicated ADM processor (i.e., a local pre-filter) is adopted to account for the RPAS manoeuvring envelope in different flight phases, in order to extend the ADM validity time across all segments of the RPAS trajectory. Sensitivity analysis of the errors caused by perturbations in the input parameters of the aircraft dynamics is performed to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed approach. Results verify that the ADM virtual sensor provides improved performance in terms of attitude data accuracy and a significant extension of the ADM validity time is achieved by pre-filtering. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Bias estimation is a critical problem in multi-sensor tracking systems, and most existing research has focused on the bias estimation of synchronous sensors; however, in practical applications, sensor measurements are usually asynchronous. The primary contribution of this paper is that a novel algorithm using B-spline interpolation time registration to achieve asynchronous sensor bias estimation is proposed. First, measurements are transformed into synchronous data using the B-spline interpolation time registration method. The time registration results are expressed as weighted results of the measurements. Second, a pseudo measurement equation is created based on the synchronous data. Compared with the pseudo measurements of other algorithms that use weighting coefficients, which are calculated by the target's state, including the target's velocity and time of arrival (TOA), a pseudo measurement that only depends on the target's position can be derived. Thus, the problem of asynchronous sensor bias estimation, particularly with manoeuvring targets, can be solved effectively by the proposed algorithm. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is verified by simulations with the target performing s-shaped manoeuvres. Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) is achievable; thus, the proposed algorithm is statistically efficient. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The paper deals with the divergence of information filter in multi sensor target tracking problem using bearing only measurements. Information filter has a number of advantages in terms of computational requirements over Kalman filter for target tracking applications. Compared to Kalman filter it also has the advantage that one can start estimation even without an initial estimate. But this filter is seen to diverge after tracking for a short period of time, even when the target is moving at a constant velocity. A technique to overcome this problem has been discussed in this paper. The information update equations of the conventional information filter are modified in terms of fuzzy function of error and change of error, and the results have been found to be encouraging. The efficacy of the technique in preventing divergence is demonstrated in the context of tracking a maneuvering target also. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Synergistic applications based on integrated hyperspectral and lidar data are receiving a growing interest from the remote-sensing community. A prerequisite for the optimum sensor fusion of hyperspectral and lidar data is an accurate geometric coalignment. The simple unadjusted integration of lidar elevation and hyperspectral reflectance causes a substantial loss of information and does not exploit the full potential of both sensors. This paper presents a novel approach for the geometric coalignment of hyperspectral and lidar airborne data, based on their respective adopted return intensity information. The complete approach incorporates ray tracing and subpixel procedures in order to overcome grid inherent discretization. It aims at the correction of extrinsic and intrinsic (camera resectioning) parameters of the hyperspectral sensor. In additional to a tie-point-based coregistration, we introduce a ray-tracing-based back projection of the lidar intensities for area-based cost aggregation. The approach consists of three processing steps. First is a coarse automatic tie-point-based boresight alignment. The second step coregisters the hyperspectral data to the lidar intensities. Third is a parametric coalignment refinement with an area-based cost aggregation. This hybrid approach of combining tie-point features and area-based cost aggregation methods for the parametric coregistration of hyperspectral intensity values to their corresponding lidar intensities results in a root-mean-square error of 1/3 pixel. It indicates that a highly integrated and stringent combination of different coalignment methods leads to an improvement of the multisensor coregistration. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Vehicle sideslip and yaw angles are critical for many vehicle safety systems. Although much research has been presented to obtain them individually, simultaneous accurate estimation of them, based on affordable sensors for land vehicle applications, is seldom reported. This paper proposes a fusion methodology for integrating a single-frequency double-antenna Global Positioning System (DA-GPS) with other low-cost in-vehicle sensors to achieve reliable estimation of both vehicle sideslip and yaw angles. The proposed methodology adopts a hybrid decentralized filtering architecture. First, a vehicle state estimator (VSE) is developed as a virtual sensor to estimate vehicle state information, mainly according to vehicle dynamics. It is composed of two parallel extended Kalman filters (EKFs). Through the interaction of two EKFs, the VSE can adapt to the variations in tire-road friction and accurately estimate the vehicle roll angle. Then, according to vehicle kinematics, a global federated estimator (GFE) is designed, based on the federated filtering algorithm, to achieve the global fusion of inertial sensors, DA-GPS, and VSE. In particular, an adaptive inference mechanism is proposed and introduced into the GFE to adapt to complex driving situations, such as GPS failure, various driving maneuvers, etc. Finally, the proposed method is evaluated via intensive simulations and experiments. The overall results show that the proposed methodology can provide reliable estimation of two angles under a wide range of driving situations. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The increase in number of deployed satellite constellations and the improvement in sensing capabilities have led to large volumes of data with a wide range of temporal and spatial coverage. The data analysis capability, however, has been lagging, and has historically focused on single-sensor individual images. We present results from an ongoing effort to develop satellite imagery analysis tools that aggregate information across multiple sensors and bands, and at multiple scales. We focus on field and landmark separation around Clinton, Iowa, and show land cover classification results that combine fused imagery from Planet Labs and Landsat 8. Classification performance is assessed using Cropland Data Layer images generated by USDA. Our method combines spectral, spatial, and temporal information to improve the accuracy of practical land cover classification. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={With growing demands for accuracy in sensor fusion, increasing attention is being paid to temporal offsets as a source of deterministic error when processing data from multiple devices. Established approaches for the calibration of temporal offsets exploit domain-specific heuristics of common sensor suites and utilize simplifications to circumvent some of the challenges arising when both temporal and spatial parameters are not accurately known a priori. These properties make it difficult to generalize the work to other applications or different combinations of sensors. This work presents a general and principled approach to joint estimation of temporal offsets and spatial transformations between sensors. Our framework exploits recent advances in continuous-time batch estimation and thus exists within the rigorous theoretical framework of maximum likelihood estimation. The derivation is presented without relying on unique properties of specific sensors and, therefore, represents the first general technique for temporal calibration in robotics. The broad applicability of this approach is demonstrated through spatiotemporal calibration of a camera with respect to an inertial measurement unit as well as between a stereo camera and a laser range finder. The method is shown to be more repeatable and accurate than the current state of the art, estimating spatial displacements to millimeter precision and temporal offsets to a fraction of the fastest measurement interval. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={The up-to-date results are presented from an ongoing study of the Data Fusion of multi-temporal and multi-sensor satellite datasets for near real time damage and debris assessment after a tornado disaster event. The space-borne sensor datasets comprising of: (i) C-band SAR dataset from RADARSAT-2; (ii) Multi-Spectral (MS) optical dataset including NIR from RapidEye; (iii) MS and panchromatic dataset of Advanced Linear Imaging (ALI), are studied for multi-sensor data fusion. A combined approach of multi-polarized radiometric and textural feature extraction, and statistical learning based feature classification is devised for fine tuning of the complex and generalized change detection model. We also investigated the use of multi-variate conditional copula as a classifier technique, by formulating the change and no-change as a binary-class classification problem in this study. The classification results from the above technique are used for assessment of damage and debris cover after the tornado disaster event. The performance of the above approach yields a very significant Kappa accuracy up to 75%. A 10-fold cross validation strategy is used for quantitative analysis of the performance of the classification model. This study will be further extended for modelling the effect of incidence angle discrepancies or climatic condition variances, which will address the heterogeneity factor in terms of local statistics of the dataset. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Activity recognition plays a key role in providing activity assistance and care for users in smart homes. In this work, we present an activity recognition system that classifies in the near real-time a set of common daily activities exploiting both the data sampled by sensors embedded in a smartphone carried out by the user and the reciprocal Received Signal Strength (RSS) values coming from worn wireless sensor devices and from sensors deployed in the environment. In order to achieve an effective and responsive classification, a decision tree based on multisensor data-stream is applied fusing data coming from embedded sensors on the smartphone and environmental sensors before processing the RSS stream. To this end, we model the RSS stream, obtained from a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) implemented as efficient Echo State Networks (ESNs), within the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm. We targeted the system for the EvAAL scenario, an international competition that aims at establishing benchmarks and evaluation metrics for comparing Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) solutions. In this paper, the performance of the proposed activity recognition system is assessed on a purposely collected real-world dataset, taking also into account a competitive neural network approach for performance comparison. Our results show that, with an appropriate configuration of the information fusion chain, the proposed system reaches a very good accuracy with a low deployment cost. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={This work addresses the design of a state observer for systems whose outputs are measured through a communication network. The measurements from each sensor node are assumed to arrive randomly, scarcely and with a time-varying delay. The proposed model of the plant and the network measurement scenarios cover the cases of multiple sensors, out-of-sequence measurements, buffered measurements on a single packet and multirate sensor measurements. A jump observer is proposed that selects a different gain depending on the number of periods elapsed between successfully received measurements and on the available data. A finite set of gains is pre-calculated offline with a tractable optimisation problem, where the complexity of the observer implementation is a design parameter. The computational cost of the observer implementation is much lower than in the Kalman filter, whilst the performance is similar. Several examples illustrate the observer design for different measurement scenarios and observer complexity and show the achievable performance. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={This article describes a new version of the Modular Airborne Camera System (MACS) [1], which has been made especially for maritime applications. The system is a successor to a High Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) MACS system which was operated in the Himalayas in 2014 [2]. Scenarios in the maritime environment require a different constellation of sensor heads, as shown in this paper. Furthermore, a method of supplying real-time capabilities to ensure flexibility in operation, as well as photogrammetric evaluation, is described. An overview of current and planned results will give an idea of the camera system's potential. The scene to be monitored is an unchanging surface; in general, nothing but water can be seen. Every change of this condition needs to be detected and classified automatically and in real-time. To ensure this, it is necessary to have more than just a camera capturing visible light, so a thermal infrared capturing camera and a hyperspectral sensor are also used. The classification results derived onboard are sent to a ground station by radio downlink. An operator in the command and control facility is then able to use this georeferenced semantic information to decide on the next steps. © 2015 IEEE.},

Recently developed model-based estimation ideas are used to improve the accuracy, robustness, and real-time characteristics considered vital for applications, where affordability and domestic use are the primary focus. We use the spatial diversity of the arbitrarily positioned Microsoft Kinect receivers to improve the reliability and promote the uptake of the concept. The skeleton-based information is fused to enhance accuracy and robustness, critical for biomedical applications. A specific version of a robust Kalman filter (KF) in a linear framework is employed to ensure superior estimator convergence and real-time use, compared to other commonly used filters. The algorithmic development was conducted in a generic form and computer simulations were conducted to verify our assertions. Hardware implementations were carried out to test the viability of the proposed state estimator in terms of the core requirements of reliability, accuracy, and real-time use. Performance of the overall system implemented in an information fusion context was evaluated against the commercially available and industry standard Vicon system for different exercise routines, producing comparable results with much less infrastructure and financial investment. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper aims at demonstrating the usefulness of integrating virtual 3D models in vehicle localization systems. Usually, vehicle localization algorithms are based on multi-sensor data fusion. Global Navigation Satellite Systems GNSS, as Global Positioning System GPS, are used to provide measurements of the geographic location. Nevertheless, GNSS solutions suffer from signal attenuation and masking, multipath phenomena and lack of visibility, especially in urban areas. That leads to degradation or even a total loss of the positioning information and then unsatisfactory performances. Dead-reckoning and inertial sensors are then often added to back up GPS in case of inaccurate or unavailable measurements or if high frequency location estimation is required. However, the dead-reckoning localization may drift in the long term due to error accumulation. To back up GPS and compensate the drift of the dead reckoning sensors based localization, two approaches integrating a virtual 3D model are proposed in registered with respect to the scene perceived by an on-board sensor. From the real/virtual scenes matching, the transformation (rotation and translation) between the real sensor and the virtual sensor (whose position and orientation are known) can be computed. These two approaches lead to determine the pose of the real sensor embedded on the vehicle. In the first approach, the considered perception sensor is a camera and in the second approach, it is a laser scanner. The first approach is based on image matching between the virtual image extracted from the 3D city model and the real image acquired by the camera. The two major parts are: 1. Detection and matching of feature points in real and virtual images (three features points are compared: Harris corner detector, SIFT and SURF). 2. Pose computation using POSIT algorithm. The second approach is based on the on-board horizontal laser scanner that provides a set of distances between it and the environment. This set of distances is matched with depth information (virtual laser scan data), provided by the virtual 3D city model. The pose estimation provided by these two approaches can be integrated in data fusion formalism. In this paper the result of the first approach is integrated in IMM UKF data fusion formalism. Experimental results obtained using real data illustrate the feasibility and the performances of the proposed approaches. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

Because each testing method makes use of a different physical principle, a multi-method approach has the potential of effectively differentiating actual defect indications from the many false alarms, thus enhancing detection reliability. In this study, we propose a new technique for aggregating scattered two- or three-dimensional sensory data. Using a density-based approach, the proposed method explicitly addresses localization uncertainties such as registration errors. This feature marks one of the major of advantages of this approach over pixel-based image fusion techniques. We provide guidelines on how to set all the key parameters and demonstrate the technique’s robustness. Finally, we apply our fusion approach to experimental data and demonstrate its capability to locate small defects by substantially reducing false alarms under conditions where no single-sensor method is adequate. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={In wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for ecological monitoring, sensing performance degrades over time due to harsh environmental conditions or battery depletion. Calibration of multisensors requires extra temporal, financial or energy resources. In order to enhance an accuracy of the multisensor measurements, we propose an approach based on interval voting in form of preference aggregation. The approach allows to determine a corrected value of a measured parameter, lying within narrow uncertainty bounds, on the basis of inaccurate measurement data, obtained from neighboring multisensors. Simulation results have shown that the proposed approach allows to achieve considerably better accuracy comparatively to other known interval voting techniques. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={When using multiple sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for monitoring (measuring) parameters of the target and sending the result to the base station (BS), data redundancy is an inevitable problem. The measured data often contains the same information, and sending redundant data to BS causes the waste of energy of sensor nodes and the risk of congestion. Multi-sensor data fusion in WSNs is a technology of gathering and processing data applied from node to BS. It improves the performance of surveillance systems by allowing the obtained sensed information from multiple sensor nodes aggregated to one unified format data packet to send to BS to make decision. In this paper, we propose a solution namely DF-AMS (Data Fusion - Average Median Sampling) for sampling and fusing data from the sensor nodes in the cluster to optimize the energy conservation of sensor nodes in clusters and cluster head node. © 2015 IEEE.},

It will improve data collection accuracy and enhance system stability through data fusion. This paper proposes a multi-sensor data fusion algorithm for greenhouse environment monitoring. First, triple exponential smoothing is applied to a variety of greenhouse environmental parameters. Then the smoothed data are sent to a router or gateway, removing invalid data, then idea of the Huffman tree is introduced to determine the order of the integration of each sensor, so as to realise multisensor data fusion. In the Institute for Farmland Irrigation Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, the tests indicated that three exponential smoothing fluctuations significantly reduce the data to improve the accuracy of the data fusion, meanwhile, running time of data fusion algorithm was significantly shorter, and better than weighted average method. © 2016 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract={In this paper a multi-sensor data fusion approach for wireless sensor system based on Bayesian strategies and Ant Colony Optimization procedures have been recommended. In this methodology, every node is furnished with various sensors (i.e. temperature and humidity sensors). Usage of more than one sensor gives additional information about the environmental conditions. The data fusion based on the competitive type hierarchical processing has been considered for experimentation. In the data fusion, the data gathered by the sensors are set in the sensing fields and afterward the data fusion probabilities are registered. In our suggested approach, the gathered temperature and humidity information are prepared by multi-sensor data fusion strategies, which then helps in diminishing the energy utilization and also communication cost through accumulation of the repetitive information. The multiple information merging process is reliable and accurate in addition to being energy-efficient which our primary goal is. The proposed algorithms were simulated utilizing Matlab. The implementation of the proposed algorithms were conducted with and without multi-sensor data fusion and the outcomes demonstrate that the proposed algorithms could reduce the energy- consumption, rather save additional energy, thus enhance the entire lifetime of the system. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2016.},

Multi-sensor technology is considered as one of the promising methods to measure and characterize these surfaces at multiple scales. This paper presents a multi-sensor data fusion based measurement method to purposely extract the geometric information of the components with different scales which is used to establish a holistic geometry of the surface via data fusion. To address the key problems of multi-sensor data fusion, an intrinsic feature pattern based surface registration method is developed to transform the measured datasets to a common coordinate frame. Gaussian zero-order regression filter is then used to separate each measured data in different scales, and the datasets are fused based on an edge intensity data fusion algorithm within the same wavelength. The fused data at different scales is then merged to form a new surface with holistic multiscale information.

Small and distribution unknown data sample obtained from multi-sensor makes the data fusion and estimation much difficult. To solve this problem, a novel bootstrap-fuzzy model is developed. This model is different from the statistical methods and only needs a little data. At first, the limited stress multi-sensor measurement data is expanded by the bootstrap sampling. Secondly, the data fusion sequence is constructed by the bootstrap distribution. Finally the true value and the interval of the stress multi-sensor measurement data are estimated by the fuzzy subordinate functions. Experimental results show that the data fusion sequence is in a good agreement with the original measurement data. The accuracy of the estimated interval can reach 85%.

abstract={Multi-sensor data fusion is extensively used to merge data collected by heterogeneous sensors deployed in smart environments. However, data coming from sensors are often noisy and inaccurate, and thus probabilistic techniques, such as Dynamic Bayesian Networks, are often adopted to explicitly model the noise and uncertainty of data. This work proposes to improve the accuracy of probabilistic inference systems by including context information, and proves the suitability of such an approach in the application scenario of user activity recognition in a smart home environment. However, the selection of the most convenient set of context information to be considered is not a trivial task. To this end, we carried out an extensive experimental evaluation which shows that choosing the right combination of context information is fundamental to maximize the inference accuracy. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.},

abstract={It has been recognized that multi-sensor data fusion can provide a more holistic, accurate and reliable information of the measured surface. Data registration, which is used to align data into one coordinate system, is a key step of data fusion. Widely used feature-based methods find correspondence between features, and then a geometrical transformation is determined to map the target data to the reference data. Reliable and accurate feature selection is thus very important for data registration. In this research, a reliable key point method called Scale Invariant Feature Method (SIFM) for data registration is investigated. By using this method, for each data, one can build a set of feature descriptors of the defined key points, which have the scale/shift/rotation invariant properties. Then the correspondence of two data and geometrical transformation can be achieved by finding the matching of two feature descriptors through closeness measurement. Initial tests on freeform and structured surfaces have proven the effectiveness and efficiency of the method.},

abstract={Reliable machining monitoring systems are essential for lowering production time and manufacturing costs. Existing expensive monitoring systems focus on prevention/detection of tool malfunctions and provide information for process optimisation by force measurement. An alternative and cost-effective approach is monitoring acoustic emissions (AEs) from machining operations by acting as a robust proxy. The limitations of AEs include high sensitivity to sensor position and cutting parameters. In this paper, a novel multi-sensor data fusion framework is proposed to enable identification of the best sensor locations for monitoring cutting operations, identifying sensors that provide the best signal, and derivation of signals with an enhanced periodic component. Our experimental results reveal that by utilising the framework, and using only three sensors, signal interpretation improves substantially and the monitoring system reliability is enhanced for a wide range of machining parameters. The framework provides a route to overcoming the major limitations of AE based monitoring. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The framework is composed of local processing and multisensor fusion processing, from which the rough and precise classification results are obtained, respectively.

abstract={Precise attitude estimation is important for navigation, guidance and control of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAV) as they are mostly equipped with low integrity sensors due to the constraints on MAV payload and available power. The MAV sensors such as accelerometer and magnetometer are prone to noise as they are placed in proximity to the motor due to constraints on centre of gravity (CG). Data from a single sensor are not reliable for all operating points of flight envelope as the motor vibration and magnetic flux due to the motor vary with RPM. Hence accurate attitude estimation of MAV is achieved through multisensor data fusion. In this paper, a modification to the classical cascade Kalman filter is proposed. Modified Cascade Kalman Filter (MCKF) has better estimation performance as it is a single Kalman filter similar to measurement fusion technique and also it restores the flexibility and computational efficiency of state vector fusion method. A numerical example is presented wherein the derived MCKF is implemented for the attitude estimation of MAV in the 6 DOF simulation model developed in MATLAB/SIMULINK and also for a set of calibrated accelerometer and magnetometer sensor data with motor noise acquired from the autopilot mounted on the rate table of the motion simulator. It was found that MCKF exhibits substantially improved performance compared to extended Kalman filter with only accelerometer data with motor noise. © 2016, IFAC (International Federation of Automatic Control) Hosting by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Decision-making algorithm, as the key technology for uncertain data fusion, is the core to obtain reasonable multisensor information fusion results. DS evidence theory is a typical and widely applicable decision-making method. However, DS evidence theory makes decisions without considering the sensors' difference, which may lead to illogical results. In this paper, we present a novel decision-making algorithm for uncertain fusion based on grey relation and DS evidence theory. The proposed algorithm comprehensively takes consideration of sensor's credibility and evidence's overall discriminability, which can solve the uncertainty problems caused by inconsistence of sensors themselves and complexity of monitoring environment and simultaneously ensure the validity and accuracy of fusion results. The innovative decision-making algorithm firstly obtains the sensor's credibility through the introduction of grey relation theory and then defines two impact factors as sensor's credibility and evidence's overall discriminability according to the focal element analyses and evidence's distance analysis, respectively; after that, it uses the impact factors to modify the evidences and finally gets more reasonable and effective results through DS combination rule. Simulation results and analyses demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can overcome the trouble caused by large evidence conflict and one-vote veto, which indicates that it can improve the ability of target judgment and enhance precision of uncertain data fusion. Thus the novel decision-making method has a certain application value. © 2016 Fang Ye et al.},

abstract={Developments in pedestrian positioning systems present a great potential to assist users with special needs, e.g., people with spatial disorientation issues. In a spatial disorientation episode a person hesitates about her/his surroundings or gets lost in otherwise familiar environments. Research in pedestrian dead reckoning has shown outstanding results about the user's position based on human locomotion patterns. In this paper, we leverage the great advances in the personal positioning field to explore the conditions of a user during a spatial disorientation episode. Here, the parameters commonly used in PDR are utilized to identify events in a spatial disorientation episode. In other words, parameters associated with the user's step are used to identify when the user walks with normal patterns or presents unusual walking patterns. Due to the lack of knowledge of events associated with SDE, experiments were conducted with the aim to observe the process to become disorientated; consequently, an empirical approach is presented. Since this is a preliminary study results were not conclusive, nevertheless, meaningful information was obtained during empirical observations in which a participant was completely immersive in a SDE.},

abstract={Freeway traffic state information from multiple sources provides sufficient support to the traffic surveillance but also brings challenges. This paper made an investigation into the fusion of a new data combination from cellular handoff probe system and microwave sensors. And a fusion method based on the neural network technique was proposed. To identify the factors influencing the accuracy of fusion results, we analyzed the sensitivity of those factors by changing the inputs of neural-network-based fusion model. The results showed that handoff link length and sample size were identified as the most influential parameters to the precision of fusion. Then, the effectiveness and capability of proposed fusion method under various traffic conditions were evaluated. And a comparative analysis between the proposed method and other fusion approaches was conducted. The results of simulation test and evaluation showed that the fusion method could complement the drawback of each collection method, improve the overall estimation accuracy, adapt to the variable traffic condition (free flow or incident state), suit the fusion of data from cellphone probes and fixed sensors, and outperform other fusion methods. © 2016 Shanglu He et al.},

abstract={This paper explores the benefits attainable by the adoption of an Aircraft Dynamics Model (ADM) to compensate for the shortcomings of employing low-cost sensors for high dynamics Remotely Piloted Aircraft System (RPAS) attitude determination tasks. Various low-cost sensors are considered for integration in the Navigation and Guidance System (NGS) including Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), vision based navigation and Micro- Electromechanical System Inertial Measurement Unit (MEMS-IMU) sensors. The ADM is essentially a knowledge-based module and is used to augment the navigation state vector by predicting the RPAS dynamics (aircraft trajectory and attitude motion). In the presented NGS, the ADM employs a six Degrees-of-Freedom (6- DoF) model. Multi-sensor data fusion is accomplished with a conventional Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and an advanced Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF). After introducing the key mathematical models describing the 6-DoF ADM, the sensor and integrated system performance are compared in a small RPAS integration scheme (i.e., AEROSONDE RPAS platform) exploring a representative cross-section of the aircraft operational flight envelope and a preliminary sensitivity analysis is performed. In addition to a centralised filter, a dedicated ADM processor (i.e., a local pre-filter) is adopted to to extend the validity time of the virtual sensor across all segments of the RPAS trajectory. Simulation results corroborate the fact that ADM augmentation of GNSS based NGS provides improved performance in terms of attitude data accuracy and a significant extension of the operational validity time is achieved by pre-filtering. © 2016 by Institute of Navigation.

The data to be fused are essentially the occupant's habits, the weather forecast as well as the notion of thermal comfort associated to the occupant's activities. Since the data are uncertain, erroneous and heterogeneous, we propose a multilevel data fusion system based on the belief theory of Dempster-Shafer for data combination and the Transferable Belief Model (TBM) for making the decision which will be a challenge.

Multisensor, multiresolution data contain complementary information and fusion of such data may result in application dependent significant information which may otherwise remain trapped within. The present work aims at improving classification by fusing features of coarse resolution hyperspectral (1 m) LWIR and fine resolution (20 cm) RGB data. The classification map comprises of eight classes. The class names are Road, Trees, Red Roof, Grey Roof, Concrete Roof, Vegetation, bare Soil and Unclassified. The processing methodology for hyperspectral LWIR data comprises of dimensionality reduction, resampling of data by interpolation technique for registering the two images at same spatial resolution, extraction of the spatial features to improve classification accuracy. In the case of fine resolution RGB data, the vegetation index is computed for classifying the vegetation class and the morphological building index is calculated for buildings. In order to extract the textural features, occurrence and co-occurence statistics is considered and the features will be extracted from all the three bands of RGB data. After extracting the features, Support Vector Machine (SVMs) has been used for training and classification. To increase the classification accuracy, post processing steps like removal of any spurious noise such as salt and pepper noise is done which is followed by filtering process by majority voting within the objects for better object classification. © 2016 SPIE.},

Finally, we construct a simulation environment to test the performance of the proposed algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can significantly enhance the accuracy of temperature detection after fusing the data obtained from different sensors.},

abstract={A novel sensor fusion design framework is presented with the objective of improving the overall multisensor measurement system performance and achieving graceful degradation following individual sensor failures. The Unscented Information Filter (UIF) is used to provide a useful tool for combining information from multiple sources. A two-step off-line and on-line calibration procedure refines sensor error models and improves the measurement performance. A Fault Detection and Identification (FDI) scheme crosschecks sensor measurements and simultaneously monitors sensor biases. Low-quality or faulty sensor readings are then rejected from the final sensor fusion process. The attitude estimation problem is used as a case study for the multiple sensor fusion algorithm design, with information provided by a set of low-cost rate gyroscopes, accelerometers, magnetometers, and a single-frequency GPS receiver's position and velocity solution. Flight data collected with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) research test bed verifies the sensor fusion, adaptation, and fault-tolerance capabilities of the designed sensor fusion algorithm. © 2016 Yu Gu et al.},

abstract={Remote sensing image analysis systems and geographic information systems (GIS) show great promise for the integration of a wide variety of spatial information supporting tasks such as urban and regional planning, natural resource management, agricultural studies and topographic or thematic mapping. Current and future remote sensing programs are based on a variety of sensors that will provide timely and repetitive multisensor earth observation on a global scale. GIS offer efficient tools for handling, manipulating, analyzing and presenting spatial data that are required for sensible decision making in various areas. The Environmental Monitoring project may serve as a convincing example of the operational use of integrated GIS/remote sensing technologies. The overall goal of the project is to assess the capabilities of satellite remote sensing for the analysis of land use changes, especially in moor areas. These areas are recognized as areas crucial to the mission of the Department of Environment and, therefore, to be placed under an extended level of protection. It is of critical importance, however, to have accurate and current information about the ecological and economic state of these sensitive areas. In selected pasture and moor areas, methods for multisensor data fusion have being developed and tested. The results of this testing show which techniques are useful for pasture and moor monitoring at an operational level. A hierarchical method is used for extracting bog land classes with respect to the environmental protection goals. A highly accurate classification of the following classes was accomplished: deciduous- and mixed forest, coniferous forest, water, very wet areas, meadowland/farmland with vegetation, meadowland/farmland with partly vegetation, meadowland/ farmland without vegetation, peat quarrying with maximum of 50% vegetation, de- and regeneration stages. In addition, a change detection analysis is performed in comparison with the existing classification of 1994-96 [7] and methods are developed to improve the classification strategy. © 2016 SPIE.},

Then, the multisensor descriptor system is transformed to a fused reduced-order non-descriptor system with correlated noise. And the weighted measurement fusion (WMF) Kalman estimator of this reduced-order subsystem is presented. According to the relationship of the presented non-descriptor system and the original descriptor system, the WMF Kalman estimator and its estimation error variance matrix of the original multisensor descriptor system are presented. The presented WMF Kalman estimator has global optimality, and can avoid computing these cross-variances of the local Kalman estimator, compared with the state fusion method.

The process is divided into two steps, On the one hand, Multi-sensor data is sent to the appropriate particle filter calculation module in order to optimize the particle distribution for the purpose updating the proposed distribution density. On the other hand, By incorporating the algorithm into the likelihood model structured by multi-sensor data, meanwhile, the low-weight particles will be modified into high-weight ones according to genetic operators and the posterior distribution will be more effectively estimated, thus high-quality particles can be obtained. Ultimately, a more precise estimate value will be achieved. A simulation experiment shows the effectiveness of the algorithm. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.},

abstract={In the current economic challenge, methods to accurately predict system failure has become a holy grail in maintenance with the goal to reduce the cost of unavailability due to unscheduled shutdown. This has led to the current research with the aim to achieve a more accurate fault diagnosis for rotating machinery using a neural network (NN) with principal component analysis (PCA) as a pre-processing step to fuse multiple sensor data. The multisensor data fusion has been proven to improve the fault detection ability for machinery compared to single source condition monitoring. In this paper, an NN-based methodology is presented, where PCA is applied as preprocessing step to detect the rotating machinery faults during operation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is illustrated by a case study on two shaft industrial gas turbine where the real-time performance monitoring data collected from the plant and used to train and test the proposed algorithm. The analysis results show that the PCA-based fusion process has significantly enhanced the performance of NNbased model when compared against NN algorithm without PCA. © 2006-2016 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

abstract={In fires, release of volatiles usually happens before generation of smoke/airborne particles. Therefore, fire detection systems based on chemical gas sensors may respond faster than systems based on smoke detectors, which currently cope the market. However, fire detectors based exclusively on gas sensors are prone to false alarms. A key element in those systems is the associated signal and data processing since the detector should discriminate fires form other volatile sources (nuisances). Here, we present a gas sensor array composed of different sensing technologies and a customized data processing algorithm for early and robust fire detection. The gas sensor array was placed in a measurement chamber along with commercially available smoke-based detectors. To test the prototype different types of fire and nuisances were performed in the chamber. Results confirmed the benefits of the gas sensing approach since nuisances were rejected and, for some types of fire, gas-based system triggered the fire alarm faster than the smoke-based detectors.},

Recently several researches, in the field of solar thermal energy production, have demonstrated that nanofluid-based solar collectors present higher conversion efficiency. In this context, the designed control unit can be used to detect their operation parameters in order to compare the performances of nanofluidbased solar collector with those of traditional one. The electronic experimental setup is capable to monitor, at the same time, the two different types of solar collector in similar environmental conditions and to show on touch screen display the detected performances. In order to have reference data, experimental measurements have been carried out by using traditional water and Al2O3-based nanofluid thermo solar collectors.

abstract={In the rolling bearing fault diagnosis, the vibration signal of single sensor is usually nonstationary and noisy, which contains very little useful information, and impacts the accuracy of fault diagnosis. In order to solve the problem, this paper presents a novel fault diagnosis method using multivibration signals and deep belief network (DBN). By utilizing the DBN's learning ability, the proposed method can adaptively fuse multifeature data and identify various bearing faults. Firstly, multiple vibration signals are acquainted from various fault bearings. Secondly, some time-domain characteristics are extracted from original signals of each individual sensor. Finally, the features data of all sensors are put into the DBN and generate an appropriate classifier to complete fault diagnosis. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of multivibration signals, experiments are carried out on the individual sensor with the same conditions and procedure. At the same time, the method is compared with SVM, KNN, and BPNN methods. The results show that the DBN-based method is able to not only adaptively fuse multisensor data, but also obtain higher identification accuracy than other methods. © 2016 Jie Tao et al.},

abstract={We consider a multisensor network fusion framework for 3-D data registration using inertial planes, the underlying geometric relations, and transformation model uncertainties. We present a comprehensive review of 3-D reconstruction methods and registration techniques in terms of the underlying geometric relations and associated uncertainties in the registered images. The 3-D data registration and the scene reconstruction task using a set of multiview images are an essential goal of structure-from-motion algorithms that still remains challenging for many applications, such as surveillance, human motion and behavior modeling, virtual-reality, smart-rooms, health-care, teleconferencing, games, human-robot interaction, medical imaging, and scene understanding. We propose a framework to incorporate measurement uncertainties in the registered imagery, which is a critical issue to ensure the robustness of these applications but is often not addressed. In our test bed environment, a network of sensors is used where each physical node consists of a coupled camera and associated inertial sensor (IS)/inertial measurement unit. Each camera-IS node can be considered as a hybrid sensor or fusion-based virtual camera. The 3-D scene information is registered onto a set of virtual planes defined by the IS. The virtual registrations are based on using the homography calculated from 3-D orientation data provided by the IS. The uncertainty associated with each 3-D point projected onto the virtual planes is modeled using statistical geometry methods. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach for multiview reconstruction with sensor fusion. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In recent times dynamic state estimation has been identified as a requirement for the modern power system. The availability of Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) has made the tracking of power system dynamic states in real time quite feasible. However, the measurement system of today's grid consists of a combination of 1) traditional slow SCADA data with low sampling rates and 2) fast PMUs having high sampling rates. Such measurements with different sampling rates pose a serious challenge in integrating them into power system dynamic state estimator. This paper addresses this problem as a special case of multi-rate multi-sensor data fusion problem and appropriately adopts a method to integrate PMU and SCADA data in the power system dynamic state estimator. The proposed method has been demonstrated using a IEEE 14 bus test case. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In order to efficiently and accurately identify the cutting condition of a shearer, this paper proposed an intelligent multi-sensor data fusion identification method using the parallel quasi-Newton neural network (PQN-NN) and the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory. The vibration acceleration signals and current signal of six cutting conditions were collected from a self-designed experimental system and some special state features were extracted from the intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) based on the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). In the experiment, three classifiers were trained and tested by the selected features of the measured data, and the DS theory was used to combine the identification results of three single classifiers. Furthermore, some comparisons with other methods were carried out. The experimental results indicate that the proposed methodperforms with higher detection accuracy and credibility than the competing algorithms. Finally, an industrial application example in the fully me hanized coal mining face was demonstrated to specify the effect of the proposed system. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Multisensor data fusion is getting more importance with the increasing number of available satellite sensors. The aim of data fusion is to take advantages of combining different types of data to improve accuracies. However features extracted from different sensors will often have different statistical properties, and therefore combining data in an efficient way is not a trivial task. This paper proposes a new algorithm for data fusion between classification maps separately derived by application of clustering algorithms to PolSAR and Multi-spectral datasets. The expected new output is a map where all the classes identified with each single dataset will be present. The pixels assigned to the same class with both datasets will be characterized by a higher likelihood to belong to that class. The application for which the data fusion has been developed is that of hazardous areas reduction in land mines clearing operation. At this purpose a demonstration site has been set up in Poland within the FP7 D-BOX project and the fusion framework tested on it with acquisition of remote sensing imagery. © 2015 IEEE.},

In Multi-sensor data fusion technology, array processing is an area of signal processing that has powerful tools for extracting information from signals collected using an array of sensors. A sensor array captures spatially propagating signals arriving from a certain direction and processes them to obtain useful information. To this end, we intend to linearly combine the signals from all the sensors with coefficients in a manner, so as to estimate transmitted data radiating from a particular direction. Current methods to calculate the weight coefficients are complex. simple and effective weight coefficient calculation method is considered and which is based on where the best features of neural network and fuzzy logic is combined. This technique is based on the optimum beamformer and makes it robust to an faulty estimate of the Direction Of Arrival (DOA) even when powerful interferences are within the uncertainty range of the desired source or contact. The new modified beamformer algorithm is the product of an effort to provide more efficient procedure for real time implementation and a better estimate of the position and spectrum of the contact which is helpful in measurement data fusion or localization. © 2015 IEEE.},

With the significant attention toward the construction of off-shore/on-shore wind farms in recent decades, the wind turbines are more threatening the avian life with increasing the risk of birds/bats collision with turbine blades. In order to address this problem, this paper proposes a fuzzy Bayesian-based multisensory data fusion approach to provide the activity information regarding the targets in the application of avian monitoring.

abstract={Indoor localization and position tracking are essential to support applications and services for ambient-assisted living. While the problem of indoor localization is still open and already quite complex per se, in large public places, additional issues of cost, accuracy, and scalability arise. In this paper, the position estimation and tracking technique developed within the project devices for assisted living (DALi) is described, analyzed through simulations, and finally validated by means of a variety of experiments on the field. The goal of the DALi project is to design a robotic wheeled walker guiding people with psychomotor problems. Indeed, people with motor or cognitive impairments are often afraid of moving in large and crowded environments (e.g., because they could lose the sense of direction). In order to mitigate this problem, the position tracking approach described in this paper is based on multisensor data fusion and it is conceived to assure a good tradeoff between target accuracy, level of confidence, and deployment costs. Quite interestingly, the same approach could be used for indoor automated guided vehicles and robotics. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

The descent image sequence acts as a link between the orbital images and the surface images. The proposed approach collects multilevel descent images, as well as inertial information from an inertial measurement unit and surface stereo vision information, to generalise a consistent surface model. A data fusion strategy is proposed to track the camera trajectory, and refined plane sweep stereo matching and 3D alignment technologies are analysed in this article.

abstract={Utilization of synchrophasor measurements for wide-area monitoring applications enables system operators to acquire real-time grid information. However, intentional injections of false synchrophasor measurements can potentially lead to inappropriate control actions, jeopardizing the security, and reliability of power transmission networks. To resolve this issue, a multisensor track-level fusion-based model prediction (TFMP) has been proposed. It has been demonstrated on a mature wide-area monitoring application, which detect electromechanical oscillations. In this paper, to extract the initial correlation information about attacked oscillation parameters, Kalmanlike particle filter (KLPF)-based smoother has been used at each monitoring node. To reduce its computational burden, the KLPF-based smoother is diagonalized into subsystems. The scheme is further supported by the characteristics of moving horizon estimates for handling continuous load fluctuations and perturbations caused by data injections in power grids. Performance evaluations are conducted using different datainjection scenarios in the IEEE New England 39 Bus system. Results show the proposed TFMP accurately extracted oscillatory parameters from the contaminated measurements in the presence of multiple system disturbances and random data injections.

abstract={Due to the phase concentration, measurement of coal/biomass/air three-phase flow is closely associated with the quantity of pollutant discharged and combustion efficiency in the pneumatic conveying system. This paper proposed a multisensor data fusion technique for the online volume concentration measurement of coal/biomass pulverized-fuel flow in cofired power plant. The techniques combine electrostatic sensors with capacitance sensors and incorporates a data fusion technique based on an adaptive wavelet neural network (AWNN), and gradient descent learning algorithm and genetic learning algorithm are used for training of the network parameters. The flow regime is first identified by performing an extreme learning machine on the electrostatic fluctuation signals, thus making the concentration measurement less affected by variations in the flow regimes. Then under the certain identified flow regime, the AWNN data fusion method was applied to determine the phase concentration. An experimental platform was built for phase concentration measurement of pulverized coal (PC)/biomass/air three-phase flow, and the test results confirmed that the technology of the concentration measurement with flow regime identification is better than that of the one without, and the maximum fiducial errors of sawdust and PC are 2.1% and 1.2%. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={A good port management system must be able to perform safe, predictable, and efficient execution of transport processes. In order to improve the quality of the port management, a robust navigation system is required, which enables to provide the positions of vessels 24/7 on either open or impeded environment. This paper describes a robust georeferencing system that could satisfy centimeter-level accuracy requirements in port environments. The design is based on the loosely coupled integration of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) technology, a terrestrial radio frequency ranging system known as Locata, and an inertial navigation system (INS). GNSS observations are processed using the precise point positioning (PPP) approach instead of the conventional differential approach. To satisfy both accuracy and reliability requirements, three integration algorithms-centralized Kalman filtering (CKF), federated Kalman filtering (FKF), and global optimal filtering (GOF)-are investigated and implemented into a triple-integrated PPP-GNSS/Locata/INS system. A preliminary performance assessment, which is based on the analysis of real data, concludes that all the three integration algorithms are able to provide centimeter-level positioning solutions. The results show that the FKF and CKF algorithms have similar performance, whereas the GOF solution has higher accuracy. Moreover, the outlier simulation is conducted and the result verifies the outlier fault-tolerant capability of the GOF-based PPP-GNSS/Locata/INS integrated system. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={A covariance intersection fusion estimation algorithm is presented for multi-sensor system with unknown covariance and noise characteristics, which means that the relativity and variance of the state noise and measurement noise are not available. Firstly, a corresponding CKF estimator is chosen for each subsystem to produce a local estimation according to the measurement data newly acquired. Secondly, based on the least matrix-weighted linear variance rule, a fast successive covariance intersection (SCI) fusion algorithm is proposed to achieve the optimal fusion estimation, which simplifies the multidimensional optimization problem into the optimization of several one-dimensional nonlinear cost functions. Thirdly, in the subsystems, a method of switching between error quaternion and error modified rodrigues parameter is used to avoid the norm constraint of quaternion and the singular problem of modified rodrigues parameter. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. © 2015, Editorial Department of Journal of Chinese Inertial Technology. All right reserved.},

abstract={Mixed reality has been proposed for industrial applications such as AR-assisted manteinance and repair in which real equipment are augmented by visual AIDS. A possible complementary use of this technology for the same context can be achieved by performing virtual training in a 'mixed reality environment' enabling to observe actual-size virtual replicas of real equipment within the physical space, providing an advantage in terms of perceptual impact and learning efficacy compared to traditional computer-based-training techniques. To this aim we present an effective hybrid tracking approach, exploiting both optical markers and inertial sensors to measure user's head position and rotation, providing both accuracy and robustness to fast head movements. A field-deployable tridimensionally-arranged marker-set, specifically designed for this kind of application, represents a further contribute of this paper, providing reliable close-to-medium distance optical tracking capabilities and increased robustness to challenging lighting conditions. First experiments confirm the potential of the proposed solution for this context and for many other applications as well. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Homotopy particle filters (HPFs), recently developed by Daum and Huang [1], present an alternative nonlinear filtering approach to sampling-based particle filters. Homotopy filters perform information update using the flow of particles to regions with high measurement likelihood. The particle flows in HPFs are solutions to a Fokker-Plank equation governing the dynamics of the posterior density function. The resulting partial differential equation is highly under-determined and has many solutions. In this work we study the nonzero-diffusion flow, and show its advantage in multisensor fusion. The nonzero-diffusion flow was chosen because it has the form of an information filter (inverse-covariance filter), and this feature makes it suitable for integration of measurement contributions from different sensors. The effectiveness of the HPF with nonzero diffusion flow as a fusion mechanism was evaluated for tracking a moving target using multiple range and bearing sensors. It is shown that the HPF requires several orders of magnitude fewer particles than a sampling-based particle filter, without loss in state estimator performance. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In joint tracking and classification (JTC) problems, both decision and estimation are involved and they affect each other. Good solutions for JTC require solving the two problems jointly. A joint decision and estimation (JDE) framework based on a generalized Bayes risk was recently proposed for solving the problem of inter-dependent decision and estimation. In the JDE framework, a conditional JDE (CJDE) risk was proposed, and the corresponding optimal solution was obtained. Due to the development of modern sensor technology, multisensor data with different characteristics are available. In this paper, we solve a JTC problem using multisensor data by the CJDE method. First, a dynamic JTC problem based on kinematic and attribute measurements is formulated as a JDE problem. To solve this problem, we propose a multiple-model recursive CJDE (RCJDE) method, which is an extension of the original RCJDE to the multisensor scenario. For joint performance evaluation, we suggest two joint performance metrics (JPM) for the cases with known and unknown ground truth, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RCJDE method. They show that the multisensor data based RCJDE can outperform the traditional two-step strategies in JPM. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={We propose a method for multisensor-multitarget tracking with excellent scalability in the number of targets (which is assumed known), the number of sensors, and the number of measurements per sensor. Our method employs belief propagation based on a 'detailed' factor graph that involves both target-related and measurement-related association variables. Using this approach, an increase in the number of targets, sensors, or measurements leads to additional variable nodes in the factor graph but not to higher dimensions of the messages. We observed very low runtimes of the proposed method; e.g., our MATLAB simulation of a scenario of 30 targets and 10 sensors without gating required less than one second per time step. The performance of the proposed method in terms of mean optimal subpattern assignment (OSPA) error compares well with that of state-of-the-art methods whose complexity scales exponentially with the number of targets. In particular, we observed that our method can outperform the sequential multisensor joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF) and performs similar to the Monte Carlo JPDAF. © 2015 IEEE.},

The main novelty introduced in this paper is the use of J-Divergence for censoring the local state estimates in conjunction with the various feedback architectures. A simulation was run on these architectures with three spatially diverse sensors and a simple non-maneuvering target. Results show that distributed architectures that provide feedback from the fusion center to the local censoring processes or to the local state estimators, yield better estimates with more one-way communication savings. © 2015 IEEE.},

At present, we have and continue to study various methodologies to process and extract information on urban surfaces, since urban growth is having environmental impacts on the involved ecological systems. The proposed method takes advantage of the fact that data fusion allows us to combine in an optimal manner, multiple sources of classifiers and to generate a single source of information. In this context, we propose the use of data fusion algorithms, by multiple classifiers, taking into account the spectral and spatial characteristics of the satellite data, which in our case are the Landsat ETM+ and the ENVISAT-ASAR. The developed system includes an ensemble fusion architecture and the use of algorithms such as Fuzzy K-mean and Markov Random Field (MRF). The study case is the Guadalajara metropolitan area, in Jalisco, Mexico, which has great growth and sprawl; in its surrounding areas there are regions which are interesting in terms of geothermal exploitation and with great ecological value. The experimental results, using the multiple classifier system (MCS) show the urban characteristics at the regional scale, offering results that are potentially significant at this scale and the direction of changes in urban growth. © 2015 IEEE.},

Based on this framework, an LRF-based detection algorithm is proposed to identify the pairs of human legs, by combining motion information and metric features. Moreover, a geometric observation model is developed for the camera to extract both the range and bearing measurements of the target person by focusing the target's shoes with the camera. Then, a near-optimal particle filter is designed to fuse the measurements from the LRF and the camera. To prevent the sample impoverishment, a procedure of sample diversity improvement is used after the resampling step. The full occlusion problem is solved using image matching based on speeded up robust feature. Note that either of the LRF and the camera can work independently, since both the range and bearing are simultaneously acquired from the LRF or the camera. As a result, flexible and robust tracking can be achieved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high tracking accuracy and robustness. Especially, only a very small number of particles suffice to maintain good tracking performance. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Sensors play an important role in the modern manufacturing and industrial processes. Their reliability is vital to ensure reliable and accurate information for condition based maintenance. For the gearbox, the critical machine component in the rotating machinery, the vibration signals collected by sensors are usually noisy. At the same time, the fault detection results based on the vibration signals from a single sensor may be unreliable and unstable. To solve this problem, this paper proposes an intelligent multi-sensor data fusion method using the relevance vector machine (RVM) based on an ant colony optimization algorithm (ACO-RVM) for gearboxes’ fault detection. RVM is a sparse probability model based on support vector machine (SVM). RVM not only has higher detection accuracy, but also better real-time accuracy compared with SVM. The ACO algorithm is used to determine kernel parameters of RVM. Moreover, the ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) is applied to preprocess the raw vibration signals to eliminate the influence caused by noise and other unrelated signals. The distance evaluation technique (DET) is employed to select dominant features as input of the ACO-RVM, so that the redundancy and inference in a large amount of features can be removed. Two gearboxes are used to demonstrate the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the ACO-RVM has higher fault detection accuracy than the RVM with normal the cross-validation (CV). © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={For the multisensor single-channel autoregressive moving average (ARMA) signals with a white measurement noise and autoregressive (AR) coloured measurement noises as common disturbance noises, a multi-stage information fusion identification method is presented when model parameters and noise variances are partially unknown. The local estimators of model parameters and noise variances are obtained by the recursive instrumental variable (RIV) algorithm, correlation method, and the Gevers-Wouters algorithm, and the fused estimators are obtained by taking the average of the local estimators. And they have the consistency. Substituting them into the optimal information fusion Kalman filter, a selftuning fusion Kalman filter with multi-model for single-channel ARMA signals is presented. Applying the dynamic error system analysis (DESA) method, it is proved that the proposed self-tuning fusion Kalman filter converges to the optimal fusion Kalman filter in a realization, so that it has asymptotic optimality.

The missing measurements of sensors are described by Bernoulli distributed random variables. Measurements of sensors are subject to external disturbances whose any prior information is unknown. Stochastic parameter uncertainties of systems are depicted by multiplicative noises. For such complex systems with multiple sensors, the Kalman-like centralized fusion and distributed fusion state one-step predictors (i.e., prior filters) independent of unknown measurement disturbances are designed based on the linear unbiased minimum variance criterion, respectively. Estimation error cross-covariance matrices between any two local predictors are derived. Their steady-state properties are analyzed.

abstract={Firefighting robots are actively being researched to reduce firefighter injuries and deaths as well as increase their effectiveness on performing tasks. There has been difficulty in making firefighting robots autonomous because the commonly used sensors for autonomous robot navigation do not perform well in fire smoke-filled environments where low visibility and high temperature are present. In order to overcome these limitations, a multi-spectral vision system was developed that uses sensor fusion between stereo thermal infrared (IR) vision and frequency modulated-continuous wave (FMCW) radar to locate objects through zero visibility smoke in real-time. In this system, the stereo IR vision was used to obtain 3-D information about the scene while the radar provided more accurate distances of objects in the field of view. Through globally matching radar objects with those in the 3-D image, the accuracy of the stereo IR vision map was updated removing the far-field inaccuracy of the stereo IR as well as ghost objects created due to stereo mismatch. The system was sufficiently fast to provide real-time matching of objects in the scene allowing for dynamic reaction object tracking and locating. Through large-scale fire experiments with and without smoke in the field of view, the distance error for the stereo IR vision was reduced from 1% to 19.0% to 1% to 2% due to sensor fusion of the stereo IR with FMCW radar. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

Evaluation of the proposed approach was performed using the largest currently available data set OU-ISIR containing inertial data of 744 subjects.

abstract={In this paper, we propose a new approach for the measurement and reconstruction of large workpieces with freeform surfaces. The system consists of a handheld laser scanning sensor and a position sensor. The laser scanning sensor is used to acquire the surface and geometry information, and the position sensor is utilized to unify the scanning sensors into a global coordinate system. The measurement process includes data collection, multi-sensor data fusion and surface reconstruction. With the multi-sensor data fusion, errors accumulated during the image alignment and registration process are minimized, and the measuring precision is significantly improved. After the dense accurate acquisition of the three-dimensional (3-D) coordinates, the surface is reconstructed using a commercial software piece, based on the Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS) surface. The system has been evaluated, both qualitatively and quantitatively, using reference measurements provided by a commercial laser scanning sensor. The method has been applied for the reconstruction of a large gear rim and the accuracy is up to 0.0963 mm. The results prove that this new combined method is promising for measuring and reconstructing the large-scale objects with complex surface geometry. Compared with reported methods of large-scale shape measurement, it owns high freedom in motion, high precision and high measurement speed in a wide measurement range. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

This paper proposes a high accuracy navigation system for high-speed trains based on a sensor fusion algorithm, with non-holonomic constraints, for multiple sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, tachometers, Doppler radar, differential GPS, and RFID, and a map matching algorithm. In the proposed system, we consider the federated Kalman filter for sensor fusion, where local filters utilize filter models developed for various sensor types. Especially, the local Kalman filter for RFID positioning, that is detected at irregular time intervals due to the varying train speed and RFID tag spacing, is developed to maintain high performance during GPS outage. In addition, an orthogonal projection map matching algorithm is developed to improve the performance of the proposed system. The performance of the proposed system is demonstrated with numerous simulations for a high-speed train in Korea.

SCIF is an efficient and robust nonlinear filter for multi-sensor data fusion. In camera networks, multiple cameras are arranged in a dispersed manner to cover a large area, and the target may appear in the blind area due to the limited field of view (FOV). Besides, each camera might receive noisy measurements. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes a novel multi-target square-root cubature information weighted consensus filter (MTSCF), which reduces the effect of clutter or spurious measurements using joint probabilistic data association (JPDA) and proper weights on the information matrix and information vector.

For this purpose, a sensing framework is presented consisting of Lidar sensors together with depth cameras. To make use of previously existing knowledge about the measuring process, an adaptive sensor model is presented with a focus on state-dependent modeling of the sensor characteristics. The model incorporates changes in the probability of detection due to the distance between the object and the sensor, occlusions, and the sensor location-dependent environment. The model is incorporated into three approximations of a Bayes optimal multiobject filter, namely, the probability hypothesis density filter, the cardinalized probability hypothesis filter, and the cardinality balanced multitarget multi-Bernoulli filter. Using labeled sequential Monte Carlo implementations, the filters are evaluated with and without the proposed adaptive sensor models for partly simulated and real data. The evaluation was done using ground truth data obtained by a marker-based motion capture system. It is shown that the adaptive model achieves superior tracking results in simulation and real experiments for all approximations with the cardinalized probability hypothesis filter producing the best results. © 1963-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Real-time monitoring of the human daily activities using wearable sensors has attracted lots of attention from researchers due to its crucial role in emerging fields such as pervasive healthcare and ambient assisted living. However, despite being an active field, recent benchmarks show a difficulty in providing robust monitoring of the different various activities under realistic everyday life conditions. In this paper, based on an in-depth understanding of the nature of 3D accelerometers and the physical properties of the different daily activities, we propose ubiMonitor as an accurate real-time activity monitor using low-cost off-theshelf three body-worn 3D accelerometers. For a robust monitoring, ubiMonitor (1) intelligently fuses the accelerometers and the acceleration in each of the three axes to provide key discriminative features for the different activities, (2) employs a novel hierarchical activity recognition scheme, and (3) applies an effective postprocessing stage to remove falsely detected activities and enhance the overall system accuracy. Experimental results using real traces from different eight subjects show that ubiMonitor can achieve an overall accuracy more than 95% with a median latency less than 3 msec. This is better than state-of-the-art by 23.4% in the recognition accuracy with a reduction of 70% in the sensors used. Copyright 2015 ACM.},

abstract={An improvement method for the pose accuracy of a robot manipulator by using a multiple-sensor combination measuring system (MCMS) is presented. It is composed of a visual sensor, an angle sensor and a series robot. The visual sensor is utilized to measure the position of the manipulator in real time, and the angle sensor is rigidly attached to the manipulator to obtain its orientation. Due to the higher accuracy of the multi-sensor, two efficient data fusion approaches, the Kalman filter (KF) and multi-sensor optimal information fusion algorithm (MOIFA), are used to fuse the position and orientation of the manipulator. The simulation and experimental results show that the pose accuracy of the robot manipulator is improved dramatically by 38%~78% with the multi-sensor data fusion. Comparing with reported pose accuracy improvement methods, the primary advantage of this method is that it does not require the complex solution of the kinematics parameter equations, increase of the motion constraints and the complicated procedures of the traditional vision-based methods. It makes the robot processing more autonomous and accurate. To improve the reliability and accuracy of the pose measurements of MCMS, the visual sensor repeatability is experimentally studied. An optimal range of 1 × 0:8 × 1 ~ 2 × 0:8 × 1 m in the field of view (FOV) is indicated by the experimental results. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

abstract={Cloud technology elevates the potential of robotics with which robots possessing various capabilities and resources may share data and combine new skills through cooperation. With multiple robots, a cloud robotic system enables intensive and complicated tasks to be carried out in an optimal and cooperative manner. Multisensor data retrieval (MSDR) is one of the key fundamental tasks to share the resources. Having attracted wide attention, MSDR is facing severe technical challenges. For example, MSDR is particularly difficult when cloud cluster hosts accommodate unpredictable data requests triggered by multiple robots operating in parallel. In these cases, near real-time responses are essential while addressing the problem of the synchronization of multisensor data simultaneously. In this paper, we present a framework targeting near real-time MSDR, which grants asynchronous access to the cloud from the robots. We propose a market-based management strategy for efficient data retrieval. It is validated by assessing several quality-of-service (QoS) criteria, with emphasis on facilitating data retrieval in near real-time. Experimental results indicate that the MSDR framework is able to achieve excellent performance under the proposed management strategy in typical cloud robotic scenarios. © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Terrain identification is essential for the control of robotic transtibial prostheses to realize smooth locomotion transitions. In this paper, we present a real-time fuzzy-logic-based terrain identification method with multisensor fusion. Five locomotion features, including the foot inclination angle at the first strike, the shank inclination angle at the first strike, foot strike sequence, the foot inclination angle at mid-stance, and the shank inclination angle at toe-off, are used to identify different terrains and terrain transitions. These features are measured by the fusion of two triaxis gyroscopes, two triaxis accelerometers, two force sensitive resistors, and a timer, which can be embedded into the prosthesis. Based on these features, a fuzzy-logic-based identification method is proposed to identify five terrains: level ground, stair ascent, stair descent, ramp ascent, and ramp descent. Moreover, a transition constraint function is developed to improve the identification performance. The execution time of the identification method is 0.79 ms pm, 0.02 ms (mean pm standard error of mean) and continuous terrain identification results show that the method can be operated online in real time. The average identification accuracy of 98.74% pm 0.32% is obtained from experiments with six able-bodied and three amputee subjects during steady locomotion periods (no terrain transition). In locomotion transition periods, all the eight transitions we studied are correctly identified and the average identification delay is 9.06% pm 3.46% of one gait cycle. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={This paper introduces an autonomous integrated indoor navigation system for ground vehicles that fuses inertial sensors, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, received signal strength (RSS) observations in wireless local area networks (WLANs), odometry, and predefined occupancy floor maps. This paper proposes a solution for the problem of automatic self-alignment and position initialization indoors under the absence of an absolute navigation system such as Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The initial tilt angles (roll and pitch) are estimated by an extended Kalman filter (EKF) that uses two horizontal accelerometers as measurements. The initial position and heading estimation is performed using a subimage matching algorithm based on normalized cross-correlation between projected 2-D LiDAR scans and an occupancy floor map of the environment. The ambiguities in position/heading initialization are resolved using RSS. The proposed position/heading estimation module is also utilized in navigation mode as a source of absolute position/heading updates to EKF for enhanced observability. The state predictor is an enhanced 3-D inertial navigation system that utilizes low-cost microelectromechanical system (MEMS)-based reduced inertial sensor set aided by vehicle odometry. In navigation mode, LiDAR scans are used to estimate the vehicle's relative motions using an inertial-aided iterative closest point algorithm. To fuse all available measurements, a multirate multimode EKF design is proposed to correct navigation states and estimate sensor biases. The developed system was tested under a real indoor office environment covered by an IEEE 802.11 WLAN on a mobile robot platform equipped with MEMS inertial sensors, a WLAN interface, a 2-D LiDAR scanner, and a quadrature encoder. Results demonstrated the capabilities of the self-alignment and initialization module and showed average submeter-level positioning accuracy. © 1967-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Maintenance and repair of wind turbine structures have become more challenging and at the same time essential as they evolve into larger dimensions or located in places with limited access. Even small structural damages may invoke catastrophic detriment to the integrity of the system. So, cost-effective, predictive, and reliable structural health monitoring (SHM) system has been always desirable for wind turbines. A real-time nondestructive SHM technique based on multisensor data fusion is proposed in this paper. The objective is to critically analyze and evaluate the feasibility of the proposed technique to identify and localize damages in wind turbine blades. The structural properties of the turbine blade before and after damage are investigated through different sets of finite-element method simulations. Based on the obtained results, it is shown that information from smart sensors, measuring strains, and vibrations data, distributed over the turbine blades can be used to assist in more accurate damage detection and overall understanding of the health condition of blades. Data fusion technique is proposed to combine these two diagnostic tools to improve the detection system that provides a more robust reading with reduced false alarms. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Multisensor data fusion can be considered as a strong nonlinear system. A precise analytical solution is challenging to obtain, thus making it hard to dissect with routine diagnostic systems. Since tried-and-true logical systems are extremely difficult to undertake, soft computing methodologies are deemed having potential for such applications. This paper presents the support vector regression (SVR) methodology for sensor fusion to improve tracking ability. Radial basis function (RBF) and polynomial function are used as SVR kernel functions. The system combines Kalman filtering and soft computing principle, i.e., SVR, to structure an effective information combination method for the target framework. A radar-infrared system is proposed to adapt contextual changes and lessen the dubious unsettling influence of an information estimation from multisensory data. The experimental results show that an improvement in predictive accuracy and generalization capability can be achieved using the SVR with RBF kernel compared with the SVR with polynomial kernel approach. © 2001-2012 IEEE.},

This paper utilizes the real-Time, recursive, and optimal estimation characteristics of unscented Kalman filter (UKF), as well as the unique advantages of multiscale wavelet transform decomposition in data analysis to effectively integrate observational data from multiple sensors. A new multiscale UKF-based multisensor data fusion algorithm is proposed by combining the UKF with multiscale signal analysis. Firstly, model-based UKF is introduced into the multiple sensors, and then the model is decomposed at multiple scales onto the coarse scale with wavelets. Next, signals decomposed from fine to coarse scales are adjusted using the denoised observational data from corresponding sensors and reconstructed with wavelets to obtain the fused signals. Finally, the processed data are fused using adaptive weighted fusion algorithm. Comparison of simulation and experimental results shows that the proposed method can effectively improve the antijamming capability of the measurement system and ensure the reliability and accuracy of sensor measurement system compared to the use of data fusion algorithm alone. © 2015 Huadong Wang and Shi Dong.},

abstract={Judgment and identification based on single fire characteristic parameter information in fire detection is subject to environmental disturbances, and accordingly its detection performance is limited with the increase of false positive rate and false negative rate. The compound fire detector employs information fusion technology to judge and identify multiple fire characteristic parameters in order to improve the reliability and accuracy of fire detection. The D-S evidence theory is applied to the multi-sensor data-fusion: first normalize the data from all sensors to obtain the normalized basic probability function of the fire occurrence; then conduct the fusion processing using the D-S evidence theory; finally give the judgment results. The results show that the method meets the goal of accurate fire signal identification and increases the accuracy of fire alarm, and therefore is simple and effective. © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={Stereo vision and LIDAR continue to dominate standoff 3D measurement techniques in photogrammetry although the two techniques are normally used in competition. Stereo matching algorithms generate dense 3D data, but perform poorly on low-texture image features. LIDAR measurements are accurate, but imaging requires scanning and produces sparse point clouds. Clearly the two techniques are complementary, but recent attempts to improve stereo matching performance on low-texture surfaces using data fusion have focused on the use of time-of-flight cameras, with comparatively little work involving LIDAR. A low-level data fusion method is shown, involving a scanning LIDAR system and a stereo camera pair. By directly imaging the LIDAR laser spot during a scan, unique stereo correspondences are obtained. These correspondences are used to seed a regiongrowing stereo matcher until the whole image is matched. The iterative nature of the acquisition process minimises the number of LIDAR points needed. This method also enables simple calibration of stereo cameras without the need for targets and trivial coregistration between the stereo and LIDAR point clouds. Examples of this data fusion technique are provided for a variety of scenes. © 2015, Copernicus. All rights reserved.},

abstract={We are interested in data fusion strategies for Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions. Advances in theory, algorithms, and computational power have made it possible to extract rich semantic information from a wide variety of sensors, but these advances have raised new challenges in fusing the data. For example, in developing fusion algorithms for moving target identification (MTI) applications, what is the best way to combine image data having different temporal frequencies, and how should we introduce contextual information acquired from monitoring cell phones or from human intelligence? In addressing these questions we have found that existing data fusion models do not readily facilitate comparison of fusion algorithms performing such complex information extraction, so we developed a new model that does. Here, we present the Spatial, Temporal, Algorithm, and Cognition (STAC) model. STAC allows for describing the progression of multi-sensor raw data through increasing levels of abstraction, and provides a way to easily compare fusion strategies. It provides for unambiguous description of how multi-sensor data are combined, the computational algorithms being used, and how scene understanding is ultimately achieved. In this paper, we describe and illustrate the STAC model, and compare it to other existing models. © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={Large time-delay usually exists in the visual localization results of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which lowers the accuracy of motion estimation. To solve this problem, a real-time motion estimation method based on multisensor data fusion is proposed. Firstly, attitude information provided by the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is fused into the monocular visual localization algorithm, so that the delay in localization results can be reduced. Then, the delay of the visual localization results is considered during the motion estimation using Kalman filter, and the measurements of the accelerometer are used to compensate the delay. With the proposed method, motion estimation results with high accuracy are obtained in real time. The method is validated by field experiments on a quadrotor system. By comparing the motion estimation results with the method without delay compensation as well as the ground truth data, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified. ©, 2015, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Inertial navigation system (INS)/global navigation satellite system (GNSS)/ celestial navigation system (CNS) integration is a promising solution to improve the performance of navigation due to the complementary characteristics of INS, GNSS, and CNS. Nevertheless, the information fusion involved in INS/GNSS/CNS integration is still an open issue. This paper presents a matrix weighted multisensor data fusion methodology with two-level structure for INS/GNSS/CNS integrated navigation system. On the first level, GNSS and CNS are integrated with INS by two local filters respectively to obtain local optimal state estimations. On the second level, two different matrix weighted data fusion algorithms, one based on generic weighting matrices and the other based on diagonal weighting matrices, are developed to fuse the local state estimations for generating the global optimal state estimation. These two algorithms are derived in the sense of linear minimum variance, which provide unbiased fusion results no matter whether the local state estimations are mutually independent or not. Thus, they overcome the limitations of the federated Kalman filter by refraining from the use of the upper bound technique. Compared with the data fusion algorithm based on generic weighting matrices, the computational load involved in the one based on diagonal weighting matrices is significantly reduced, even though its accuracy is slightly lower due to the disregard of the coupled relationship between the components of the local state estimations. The effectiveness of the proposed matrix weighted multisensor data fusion methodology is verified through Monte Carlo simulations and practical experiments in comparison with the federated Kalman filter. © 2015 Institution of Mechanical Engineers.},

abstract={In this paper, we study the data fusion of visible and near infrared (VNIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery. VNIR image gives high spatial resolution and clear edge expression information while TIR image gives Earth's surface temperature information. Frequently, it is not easy to utilize the TIR images in many remote sensing applications, because the TIR images does not have a good spatial resolution enough to describe spatial details. Thus, in order to improve the TIR image's availability and utilization, a multi-sensor data fusion of TIR and VNIR is quite necessary. In this paper, we have proposed an efficient way to fuse the VNIR and TIR images of Landsat 5 TM and ASTER. The panchromatic images is generated by using principal component analysis (PCA) from multi-spectral images, and the fused image is created by merging the panchromatic and thermal images. And finally, the performance test of the proposed fusion method is performed by using entropy concept. The method can be applied to detect hot-spot area such as forest fire and investigate a nuclear test and a surface temperature change in urban area.},

The developed approach exploits the complementarity of the two acquired data sets. To represent the whole set of measurements in a common reference frame, a fusion method is developed based on the geometric characteristics of the workpiece used to define a cost function, which allows perfect alignment of the two point sets. This is further favored by use of a camera common to the two sensory systems.

abstract={Nonlinear filtering is a lasting and challenging topic in information fusion filed all along. Due to the complexity of nonlinear systems, it makes that data fusion based on nonlinear filtering distinctly differs from the traditional linear data fusion. For the linear Kalman fusion, there are some important properties, for example, equivalence of the Kalman filter and its information filtering form and equivalence between sequential fusion algorithms based on the direct Kalman filtering and the information filtering. However, we cannot directly and subjectively ensure that all of conclusions or properties in linear fusion can be followed for nonlinear systems because performance of nonlinear fusion depends closely on the concrete nonlinear filters. For these, we study two equivalent problems on estimation fusion accuracies. The first is estimation equivalence of the direct cubature Kalman filter and its associated information filter and the second is to theoretically prove fusion accuracy equivalence of two multisensor sequential fusion methods based on the direct cubature Kalman filter and the information filter. The results on theoretical proof and simulation examples show explicitly and clearly that the two equivalence properties existed in the current linear Kalman estimation fusion can be completely succeeded in the cubature Kalman estimation fusion for nonlinear systems. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The multi-sensor data fusion relies on a combination of information pieces to produce a more accurate or complete description of the environment. In this work, we considered the case of a surveillance system using several heterogeneous sensors in a network. In such a system, the data fusion objective is to merge the detections provided by the different sensors in order to count, locate and track all the targets in the monitored area. The problem was addressed in the context of Belief Function theory in order to cope with the high inaccuracy of information and the different forms of imprecision. In this framework, we developed a unified approach to model and merge the detections coming from various kinds of sensors with prior knowledge about target location derived from topographical elements. We showed that the developed belief model provided an efficient measurement for data association between tracks and detections. Considering scalable constraints for the system, the complexity and consistency of belief function representation should be controlled, which was achieved by implementing versatile discernment frames and by restricting the number of focal elements. The proof of concept of the proposed data fusion module was achieved by implementing it in an actual detection system. Real-world scenarios were used to draw some conclusions about localization performance and end-user perception. Further experiments were also performed on simulated data to focus on data association and belief function simplification subproblems. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have emerged as the most effective technology enabling not only new e-Health methods and systems but also novel applications in human-centered areas such as electronic health care, fitness/welness systems, sport performance monitoring, interactive games, factory workers monitoring, and social physical interaction.

Indeed, BSNs can proactively interact and collaborate to foster novel BSN applications centered on collaborative groups of individuals.

They can support the development of novel smart wearable systems for cyberphysical pervasive computing environments. Collaboration therefore relies on interaction and synchronization among the CBSNs and on collaborative distributed computing atop the collaborating CBSNs. Specifically, collaboration is triggered upon CBSN proximity and relies on service-specific protocols allowing for managing services among the collaborating CBSNs. C-SPINE also natively supports multi-sensor data fusion among CBSNs to enable joint data analysis such as filtering, time-dependent data integration and classification. To demonstrate its effectiveness, C-SPINE is used to implement e-Shake, a collaborative CBSN system for the detection of emotions. The system is based on a multi-sensor data fusion schema to perform automatic detection of handshakes between two individuals and capture of possible heart-rate-based emotion reactions due to the individuals' meeting. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={This work considers the problem of building high-fidelity 3D representations of the environment from sensor data acquired by mobile robots. Multi-sensor data fusion allows for more complete and accurate representations, and for more reliable perception, especially when different sensing modalities are used. In this paper, we propose a thorough experimental analysis of the performance of 3D surface reconstruction from laser and mm-wave radar data using Gaussian Process Implicit Surfaces (GPIS), in a realistic field robotics scenario. We first analyse the performance of GPIS using raw laser data alone and raw radar data alone, respectively, with different choices of covariance matrices and different resolutions of the input data. We then evaluate and compare the performance of two different GPIS fusion approaches. The first, state-of-the-art approach directly fuses raw data from laser and radar. The alternative approach proposed in this paper first computes an initial estimate of the surface from each single source of data, and then fuses these two estimates. We show that this method outperforms the state of the art, especially in situations where the sensors react differently to the targets they perceive. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Autonomous Navigation Vehicle (AUV) navigates to the specified longitude and latitude on water surface by means of Global Positioning System (GPS), Inertial Navigation System (INS) and Electronic Compass (EC), then dives to the specified depth according to the measurements of Depth Gauge (DG). To overcome the low location accuracy of existing navigation technologies in AUV, an integrated navigation method based on multi-sensor data fusion of GPS/INS/EC/DG has been proposed. Since the systematic stability and high precision in short-term measurement of INS, it takes the INS as common reference system. The problem which measurement error accumulates with time is solved by the combination of four sub-filters and a main filter. The sub-filters output the measured velocity, position, orientation and depth error to the main filter, which fuse the data to obtain the global optimal estimation and feedback to the INS system. Realistic environment parameters are simulated in MATLAB to verify the rationality of the navigation algorithm. The feasibility of method is proved by the comparison of position errors with and without combined navigation. © 2015 SERSC.},

This paper examines a fusion method based on logarithmic opinion pools and develops algorithms for multi-sensor data fusion as well as investigates weight selection schemes for the opinion pool using efficient quadrature integration methods. The proposed fusion rules are applied to the tracking of a space object using multiple ground-based optical sensors.

abstract={An increasing amount of commercial measurement instruments implementing a wide range of measurement technologies is rapidly becoming available for dimensional and geometric verification. Multiple solutions are often acquired within the shop-floor with the aim of providing alternatives to cover a wider array of measurement needs, thus overcoming the limitations of individual instruments and technologies. In such scenarios, multisensor data fusion aims at going one step further by seeking original and different ways to analyze and combine multiple measurement datasets taken from the same measurand, in order to produce synergistic effects and ultimately obtain overall better measurement results. In this work an original approach to multisensor data fusion is presented, based on the development of Gaussian process models (the technique also known as kriging), starting from point sets acquired from multiple instruments. The approach is illustrated and validated through the application to a simulated test case and two real-life industrial metrology scenarios involving structured light scanners and coordinate measurement machines. The results show that not only the proposed approach allows for obtaining final measurement results whose metrological quality transcends that of the original single-sensor datasets, but also it allows to better characterize metrological performance and potential sources of measurement error originated from within each individual sensor. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Conflict among information sources is a feature of fused multisource and multisensor systems. Accordingly, the subject of conflict resolution has a long history in the literature of data fusion algorithms such as that of Dempster-Shafer theory (DS). Most conflict resolution strategies focus on distributing the conflict among the elements of the frame of discernment (the set of hypotheses that describe the possible decisions for which evidence is obtained) through rescaling of the evidence. These "closed-world" strategies imply that conflict is due to the uncertainty in evidence sources stemming from their reliability. An alternative approach is the "open-world" hypothesis, which allows for the presence of «unknown» elements not included in the original frame of discernment. Here, conflict must be considered as a result of uncertainty in the frame of the discernment, rather than solely the province of evidence sources. Uncertainty in the operating environment of a fused system is likely to appear as an open-world scenario. Understanding the origin of conflict (source versus frame of discernment uncertainty) is a challenging area for research in fused systems. Determining the ratio of these uncertainties provides useful insights into the operation of fused systems and confidence in their decisions for a variety of operating environments. Results and discussion for the computation of these uncertainties are presented for several combination rules with simulated data sets. © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={Automated vehicles require an adequate and reliable perception of the surrounding world in order to make good decisions. Using vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to exchange location data (i.e. time, position, heading and speed) can improve the perception beyond the capabilities of traditional on-board sensors (e.g. radar, lidar). However, it is vital to trust the data before it is being used. Cryptographic mechanisms can protect the exchange and authenticity of data but do not guarantee the correctness of the content. In this paper we present a vision-based multi-object tracking system for checking the plausibility of V2V communication. The system is addressing the challenge of fusing relative sensor observations as provided by a MobilEye vision-system with time-delayed absolute GNSS-based measurements from Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) as provided by V2V. The plausibility check is implemented in a prototype and based on a state-of-the-art multiple-object tracking algorithm.

abstract={In this paper, a novel method for mobile sensor node tracking using semi-supervised Hidden Markov Models (HMM) is discussed. A new methodology to develop a combined attenuation model from data gathered from multiple sensors is also described. Observations emitted from the nodes are sparsely measured over the network area with beacons placed on the boundaries. HMMs are trained using observations measured at each grid point. The distances between a node passing through a specific grid point and beacons are estimated using likelihood maximization. The local location co-ordinates of the node positions are then computed by solving a constrained volume optimization problem. Quaternion rotation is used to finally obtain global coordinates of the node location. Several standard manoeuvres of mobile nodes are first simulated. Similar manoeuvres are also recorded from real field deployments. The experimental results are obtained for node localization and tracking from these experiments. Results indicate an improvement in the localization accuracy, when compared to the conventional localization methods. © 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Automatic sign language recognition plays an important role in communications for sign language users. Most existing sign language recognition systems use single sensor input. However, such systems may fail to recognize hand gestures correctly due to occluded regions of hand gestures. In this work, we propose a novel system for real-time recognition of the digits in American Sign Language (ASL) [1]. The proposed system [2] utilizes two Leap Motion sensors [3] to capture hand gestures from different angles. Sensory data are preprocessed using a multi-sensor data fusion approach and ASL digits are recognized in real-time from the fused data using Hidden Markov models (HMM) [4]. Experimental results of the proposed sign language recognition system demonstrate its improved performance over single sensor systems. With a low implementation cost and a high recognition accuracy, the proposed system can be widely adopted in many real world applications and bring conveniences to world-wide ASL users. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={In this paper we discuss the problem of combining sensor information for two main detection problems: 1) two variants of a spatial search problem and 2) a fault detection problem for a three tank system (TTS). In all cases the assumption is that data may be collected from multiple sensors. The goal is then to combine all the information to determine whether an object (or fault) is present in a given area. In our setting there exist two main types of sensors, namely: 'small' and 'large' sensors. Essentially, it is assumed that small sensors can inspect an area that is relatively small in comparison to that which the large sensor can inspect. By deriving a relationship between small and large sensor measurements we combine data using a maximum likelihood based methodology. In particular, each detection problem is initially formulated as a system identification problem. Here, the large sensor collects data on the full system while small sensors collect data on subsystems. By establishing a connection of this identification problem to existing literature, we can obtain asymptotic convergence and asymptotic normality results. © 2015 American Automatic Control Council.},

abstract={With the amount of biomedical data growing explosively, medical scientists use many datasets in research for new medicine. However, the amount of biomedical data is growing too fast to abstract hidden information. At the same time, with the development of data storage diversification, scientists prefer to have data fusion based on heterogeneous data sources as opposed to a single data source, and ultimately to achieve knowledge and discovery across heterogeneous databases. Our study focuses on extending the application of latent semantic analysis methodologies into the area of biomedical research. Our purpose is to develop a model for discovering potential relationships between medicines and diseases based on biomedical latent semantic analysis. This model could be used in constructing link maps for biomedical entities, and provide a theoretical basis and practical support for biomedical scientists in their study of the disease-medicine relationship. In detail, we discuss the study of the integration of the latent semantic analysis model and data fusion methodologies. Our result fusion solution combines scientific literature repositories and a biomedical database based on context and the ABC model, and is supervised by a semi-supervised learning algorithm and data fusion algorithms. The expectation is that fused data could represent multilevel potential relationships between biological entities and related emotional relationship expression. The model is validated by experience and proven to be feasible and effective. © The Author(s) 2015.},

abstract={The present generation of mobile handheld devices comes equipped with a large number of sensors. The key sensors include the Ambient Light Sensor, Proximity Sensor, Gyroscope, Compass and the Accelerometer. Many mobile applications are driven based on the readings obtained from either one or two of these sensors. However the presence of multiple-sensors will enable the determination of more detailed activities that are carried out by the user of a mobile device, thus enabling smarter mobile applications to be developed that responds more appropriately to user behavior and device usage. In the proposed research we use recent advances in machine learning to fuse together the data obtained from all key sensors of a mobile device. We investigate the possible use of single and ensemble classifier based approaches to identify a mobile device's behavior in the space it is present. Feature selection algorithms are used to remove non-discriminant features that often lead to poor classifier performance. As the sensor readings are noisy and include a significant proportion of missing values and outliers, we use machine learning based approaches to clean the raw data obtained from the sensors, before use. Based on selected practical case studies, we demonstrate the ability to accurately recognize device behavior based on multi-sensor data fusion. © 2015 SPIE.},

A route planning file containing flight paths and automatic exposure points is firstly derived by the route plan software to control the whole aerial photography task. As for the most challenging task, accurate attitude estimation, a custom Kalman filtering hardware module based on FPGA is introduced. The introduced module invokes the build-in multipliers of FPGA to achieve Kalman filtering hardware implementation, which leads to a rapid attitude estimation. After that mechanical structure of a specialized pan-tilt is designed and fabricated to adjust the camera attitude to the vertical direction of the ground plane. The practice aerial survey is also conducted to evaluate the accuracy and performance of designed control system.

abstract={3D modeling of scene contents takes an increasing importance for many computer vision based applications. In particular, industrial applications of computer vision require efficient tools for the computation of this 3D information. Routinely, stereo-vision is a powerful technique to obtain the 3D outline of imaged objects from the corresponding 2D images. As a consequence, this approach provides only a poor and partial description of the scene contents. On another hand, for structured light based reconstruction techniques, 3D surfaces of imaged objects can often be computed with high accuracy. However, the resulting active range data in this case lacks to provide data enabling to characterize the object edges. Thus, in order to benefit from the positive points of various acquisition techniques, we introduce in this paper promising approaches, enabling to compute complete 3D reconstruction based on the cooperation of two complementary acquisition and processing techniques, in our case stereoscopic and structured light based methods, providing two 3D data sets describing respectively the outlines and surfaces of the imaged objects. We present, accordingly, the principles of three fusion techniques and their comparison based on evaluation criterions related to the nature of the workpiece and also the type of the tackled application. The proposed fusion methods are relying on geometric characteristics of the workpiece, which favour the quality of the registration. Further, the results obtained demonstrate that the developed approaches are well adapted for 3D modeling of manufactured parts including free-form surfaces and, consequently quality control applications using these 3D reconstructions. © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={Purpose: There are high expectations for reliability, safety and fault tolerance are high in chemical plants. Control systems are capable of potential faults in the plant processing systems. This paper proposes is a new Fault Tolerant Control (FTC) system to identify the probable fault occurrences in the plant. Design/methodology/approach: A Fault Diagnosis and Isolation (FDI) module has been devised based on the estimated state of system. An Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is the main innovation of the FDI module to identify the faults. A Multi-Sensor Data Fusion algorithm is utilized to integrate the UKF output data to enhance fault identification. The UKF employs an augmented state vector to estimate system states and faults simultaneously. A control mechanism is designed to compensate for the undesirable effects of the detected faults. Findings: The performance of the Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) without any fault compensation is compared with the proposed FTC scheme under different fault scenarios. Analysis of the simulation results indicates that the FDI method is able to identify the faults accurately. The proposed FTC approach facilitates recovery of the closed loop performance after the faults have been isolated. Originality/value: A significant contribution of the paper is the design of an FTC system by using UKF to estimate faults and enhance the accuracy of data. This is done by applying a data fusion algorithm and controlling the system by the NMPC after eliminating the effects of faults. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.},

abstract={With the growing deployment of host and network intrusion detection systems, managing reports from these systems becomes critically important. We present a probabilistic approach to alert correlation, extending ideas from multisensor data fusion. Features used for alert correlation are based on alert content that anticipates evolving IETF standards. The probabilistic approach provides a unified mathematical framework for correlating alerts that match closely but not perfectly, where the minimum degree of match required to fuse alerts is controlled by a single configurable parameter. Only features in common are considered in the fusion algorithm. For each feature we define an appropriate similarity function. The overall similarity is weighted by a specifiable expectation of similarity. In addition, a minimum similarity may be specified for some or all features. Features in this set must match at least as well as the minimum similarity specification in order to combine alerts, regardless of the goodness of match on the feature set as a whole. Our approach correlates attacks over time, correlates reports from heterogeneous sensors, and correlates multiple attack steps. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2001.},

High resolution RGB image and lower resolution thermal infrared image from the same urban area were processed to perform classification of each higher resolution pixel. Development of a fast and straightforward procedure was targeted and combined classifiers are proposed for that, exploiting spectral features from each data set separately. It is shown that data fusion can be achieved using the proposed classifiers and improvement of classification quality can be obtained with respect to the cases where only one of the data sets is used.

abstract={To solve the invalidation problem of Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence (DS) with high conflict in multisensor data fusion, this paper presents a novel combination approach of conflict evidence with different weighting factors using a new probabilistic dissimilarity measure. Firstly, an improved probabilistic transformation function is proposed to map basic belief assignments (BBAs) to probabilities. Then, a new dissimilarity measure integrating fuzzy nearness and introduced correlation coefficient is proposed to characterize not only the difference between basic belief functions (BBAs) but also the divergence degree of the hypothesis that two BBAs support. Finally, the weighting factors used to reassign conflicts on BBAs are developed and Dempster's rule is chosen to combine the discounted sources. Simple numerical examples are employed to demonstrate the merit of the proposed method. Through analysis and comparison of the results, the new combination approach can effectively solve the problem of conflict management with better convergence performance and robustness. © 2015 Mengmeng Ma and Jiyao An.},

abstract={In order for Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (RPAS) to coexist seamlessly with manned aircraft in non-segregated airspace, enhanced navigational capabilities are essential to meet the Required Navigational Performance (RNP) levels in all flight phases. A Multi-Sensor Data Fusion (MSDF) framework is adopted to improve the navigation capabilities of an integrated Navigation and Guidance System (NGS) designed for small-sized RPAS. The MSDF architecture includes low-cost and low weight/volume navigation sensors suitable for various classes of RPAS. The selected sensors include Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) based Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Vision Based Sensors (VBS). A loosely integrated navigation architecture is presented where an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is used to combine the navigation sensor measurements. The presented UKF based VBS-INS-GNSS-ADM (U-VIGA) architecture is an evolution of previous research performed on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based VBS-INS-GNSS (E-VIGA) systems. An Aircraft Dynamics Model (ADM) is adopted as a virtual sensor and acts as a knowledge-based module providing additional position and attitude information, which is pre-processed by an additional/local UKF. The E-VIGA and U-VIGA performances are evaluated in a small RPAS integration scheme (i.e., AEROSONDE RPAS platform) by exploring a representative cross-section of this RPAS operational flight envelope. The position and attitude accuracy comparison shows that the E-VIGA and U-VIGA systems fulfill the relevant RNP criteria, including precision approach in CAT-II. A novel Human Machine Interface (HMI) architecture is also presented, whose design takes into consideration the coordination tasks of multiple human operators. In addition, the interface scheme incorporates the human operator as an integral part of the control loop providing a higher level of situational awareness. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Due to their excellent mechanical properties and light weight, fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) has a huge potential as a way to reduce vehicle and airplane weight and is therefore a subject of interest for aerospace and automotive industries.

Currently, there is no automated monitoring system capable of ensuring quality in NCF production. The purpose of this study is to develop tools and concepts that could lead to fully-automated quality control of non-crimp fabrics. Useful sensor concepts were developed based on a thorough requirement analysis. Sensor data fusion strategies were conceived and evaluated to combine image processing information and basis weight sensor information with the purpose of detecting relevant quality features in a textile sample. The developed algorithm was tested on a textile sample and a corresponding defect map was generated. Results showed that it is possible to identify common textile defect types by combining these two sensors.},

abstract={Multisensory data fusion-based online welding quality monitoring has gained increasing attention in intelligent welding process. This paper mainly focuses on the automatic detection of typical welding defect for Al alloy in gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) by means of analzing arc spectrum, sound and voltage signal. Based on the developed algorithms in time and frequency domain, 41 feature parameters were successively extracted from these signals to characterize the welding process and seam quality. Then, the proposed feature selection approach, i.e., hybrid fisher-based filter and wrapper was successfully utilized to evaluate the sensitivity of each feature and reduce the feature dimensions. Finally, the optimal feature subset with 19 features was selected to obtain the highest accuracy, i.e., 94.72% using established classification model. This study provides a guideline for feature extraction, selection and dynamic modeling based on heterogeneous multisensory data to achieve a reliable online defect detection system in arc welding. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract={Monitoring systems for the safety of building structure (SBS) can provide people with important data related to main supporting points in a building and then help people to make a reasonable maintenance schedule. However, more and more data bring a challenge for data management and data mining. In order to meet this challenge, under the framework of Wisdom Web of Things (W2T), we design a monitoring system for the SBS by using the semantic and the multisource data fusion technologies. This system establishes a dynamical data cycle among the physical world (buildings), the social world (humans), and the cyber world (computers) and provides various services in the monitoring process to alleviate engineers' workload. Furthermore, all data in the cyber world are organized as the raw data, the semantic information, and the multisource knowledge. Based on this organization, we can concentrate on the data fusion from the viewpoints of time, space, and multisensor. At last, a prototype system powered by the semantic platform LarKC is tested from the aspects of sample performance and time consumption. In particular, noisy data (i.e., inconsistent, abnormal, or error data) are detected through the fusion of multisource knowledge, and some rule-based reasoning is conducted to provide personalized service. © 2015 Haiyuan Wang et al.},

abstract={This paper presents a new concept of UAV mission design in geomatics, applied to the generation of thematic maps for a multitude of civilian and military applications. We discuss the architecture of Mission-Oriented Sensors Arrays (MOSA), proposed in Figueira et Al. (2013), aimed at splitting and decoupling the mission-oriented part of the system (non safety-critical hardware and software) from the aircraft control systems (safety-critical). As a case study, we present an environmental monitoring application for the automatic generation of thematic maps to track gunshot activity in conservation areas. The MOSA modeled for this application integrates information from a thermal camera and an on-the-ground microphone array. The use of microphone arrays technology is of particular interest in this paper. These arrays allow estimation of the direction-of-arrival (DOA) of the incoming sound waves. Information about events of interest is obtained by the fusion of the data provided by the microphone array, captured by the UAV, fused with information from the termal image processing. Preliminary results show the feasibility of the on-the-ground sound processing array and the simulation of the main processing module, to be embedded into an UAV in a future work. The main contributions of this paper are the proposed MOSA system, including concepts, models and architecture.},

abstract={Understanding the dynamics and processes of the ice sheets is crucial for predicting the behavior of climate change. A potential approach to achieve this is by using high resolution (HR) digital elevation models (DEMs) of the ice surface derived from remote sensing radar or laser altimeters. Unfortunately, at present HR DEMs of large portions of the ice sheets are not available. To address this issue, in this paper we propose a multisensor data fusion technique for the generation of a HR DEM of the ice sheets, which fuses two types of data, i.e., radargrams acquired by radar sounder (RS) instruments and ice surface elevation data measured by altimeter (ALT) instruments. The aim of the technique is to generate a DEM of the ice surface at the best possible horizontal resolution by exploiting the complementary characteristics of the RS and ALT data. This is done by defining a novel processing scheme that involves image processing techniques based on data rescaling, geostatistical interpolation and multiresolution analysis (MRA). The method has been applied to a subset of RS and ALT data acquired over a portion of the Byrd Glacier in Antarctica. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={Bad shunting of track circuit is one of the major risks for railway traffic safety. The occupancy of track will not be correctly detected due to bad shunting, which could severely degrade the efficiency of the train dispatching command, sometimes even causing serious accidents, such as train collision and derailment. To handle the bad shunting problem, the Three Points Test Method is commonly used for detecting track occupancy. However, this method completely relies on manual confirmation and it thus usually leads to low detection efficiency and high labor intensity. In order to improve the detection efficiency and involve as less human labors as possible, this paper proposes a multisensor track occupancy detection model which is based on chaotic neural networks. This model uses the detection results of track occupancy collected by multiple sensors as the fundamental data, and then it calculates their weights using chaotic neural networks for data fusion, and finally the model determines whether the track is occupied. Experimental results and field tests demonstrate that the proposed model is able to provide track occupancy detection with high effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, the accuracy of detection reaches 99.9999%, which can help to greatly reduce the labor intensity of manual confirmation. © 2015 Ze-xi Hua and Xiang-dong Chen.},

abstract={This paper describes the integration of Locata, GNSS and INS technologies within a loosely-coupled triple integration algorithm. The conventional methods for multi-sensor integration can be classified as either centralised filtering or decentralised filtering. Centralised Kalman filtering (CKF) provides globally optimal state estimation by directly combining measurement data. However CKF system has some disadvantages such as a comparatively large computational burden and poor fault detection and isolation ability. Decentralised Kalman filtering (DKF) addresses such defects while aiming to achieve the same accuracy as a centralised filter. On the other hand global optimal filtering (GOF) can achieve a higher accuracy than the traditional CKF because it utilises more information resources than the CKF. In the information space, the information resources that can be used for estimation include the measurements, the local predictions, and the global predictions. In order to evaluate the system performance, a field experiment was conducted on a vehicle with different kinds of maneuvers, including circular motion and accelerated motion. The results indicate that: (1) GOF-based PPP-GNSS/ Locata/INS integration system can provide better positioning accuracy compared with CFK and federated Kalman filtering; (2) covariance analysis shows that the GOF improves the system estimation covariance; and (3) a comparison of GOF with local filters confirms the superiority of a GOF-based triple integration system. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2015.},

abstract={Measuring bridge deflection under dynamic loading is useful to understand structural behavior as well as to assess health condition. However, the conventional approaches for the deflection measurements in large-scale bridges are challenging as they typically require fixed reference points that may be often unavailable in the fields. Alternatively, indirect estimation methods have been developed; other measurements such as acceleration or strain are first obtained and subsequently transformed to displacement. As the acceleration and strain are conveniently measured, the indirect estimation methods are considered to be effective and practical while they have in general lower accuracy in estimation compared to the conventional direct measurement. This study proposes a multisensor fusion approach combining acceleration and strain for bridge deflection estimation with improved accuracy. A mathematical formulation based on Kalman filtering is presented for the fusion of the different physical quantities to estimation vertical deflections. Both numerical and experimental validations are presented to show the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed approach. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London.},

abstract={As multiple traffic data sources have become available recently, a new opportunity has been provided for improving the accuracy of shortterm travel time forecasting by fusing different but valid data sources. However, previous studies seldom quantified and integrated the reliability of data sources into model development to achieve the potential promised by data fusion. This paper proposes a combined method for short-term travel time forecasting for urban road links that uses travel time extracted from fixed vehicle detectors and probe vehicle data. The method uses the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model to forecast the mean and variance of each type of travel time data source, and the Dempster-Shafer model is used to calculate the fusion weights iteratively. Real-world data collected on urban roads in Kunshan, China, were used to validate and evaluate the proposed method. Empirical results show that the proposed method can effectively capture the variance of each type of travel time data source for iteratively calculating the fusion weights and hence can produce accurate travel time forecasts. Moreover, through a comparison with the alternative methods, the proposed method is shown to be able to consistently generate improved performance under varying traffic conditions.},

abstract={Next generation avionics Size Weight and Power (SWaP) can benefit from transformational improvements and flexibility in processing brought on by Moore's Law with proper heterogeneous pooled processor solutions. It is no longer feasible to simply use a modest number of network-connected single-core processors in isolated subsystems; instead, multicore processing is the norm By 2016-2018, there will be on-chip multicore processors with 16 or more cores on each die integrated with on-chip transformational multi-Teraflop General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPUs). Heterogeneous reprogrammable System-on-Chip (SoC) devices will include multicore processors mixed with 5 billion transistor Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). At this time, many avionics subsystems are just beginning the integration of multicore into safe and secure systems. Similarly, sensor critical avionics systems are still adjusting their heterogeneous processing mix in multicore, FPGA, and GPGPU processing solutions. Pooled processing across subsystems is still very limited in deployment. Subsystem level partitioning and security/safety considerations often still limit the potential SWAP improvement for pooled processing if not properly planned and managed. Legacy software migration also continues to make pooled processing in tech refresh a challenge. This paper presents results of an initial investigation into relevant dual use parallels from adjacent markets with similar challenges. One of the adjacent markets that can be used for open discussion of the heterogeneous pooled processor challenge is the driverless car processor architecture. There are already developments with Teraflop computing in the glove compartment, modular multi-sensor data fusion sensor software, integrated information and infrastructure hardware security, and standards for on-platform/off-platform cloud integration. Future cars will have hardware that runs up to 100 Million lines of code.

abstract={Multisensor distributed information fusion state estimator is presented in this paper. The algorithm deals with descriptor and non descriptor discrete time time-invariant stochastic linear system which is described by state space model. Under the assumption of the observability of the system, the state of the system is a linear combination of input white noise, observation white noise and observation signal. Further non-recursive state estimators algorithm is presented, which can be computed by the white noise estimators and measurement predictor. In order to improve the accuracy of the state estimator, this paper presents information fusion algorithm including matrix weighted, diagonal matrices weighted, scalar weighted and covariance intersection fusion, in the sense of linear minimum variance. The formula of optimal weighting coefficients is given. The algorithm analyzes the relationship between the accuracy and the computation of the four fusion algorithm. A simulation example for non descriptor system with 3 sensors shows its correctness and effectiveness. © 2015 SERSC.},

abstract={In cloud sensor system-based smart-living applications, large-scale distributed sensors may be deployed to collect information and report to the manipulator and the cloud. A gateway is often employed as infrastructure in this scenario, acting as the data collector, the relay and the agency of the initial multisensor fusion, and thus must be able to handle as many concurrent requests as possible from diverse sensors of different vendors. This study proposes a high-performance scheduling model with a cloud-supported caching mechanism for the gateway of the cloud sensor system-based smart-living. Scheduling and caching optimization are performed by 0-1 programming combined with the periodic task models. Correlation analyses of the simulated results determine the most effective factors to the performance, and the performance tests with the selected factors show that a gateway with 2.4 G-uniCPU/4 G-memory/300 G-harddisk can support the system with one million sensors registered in the cloud and 5000 concurrent live sensors through it, with a 25× gain throughput improvement compared to the traditional application-type scheduling. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Oil palm is recognized as the golden crop. It produces the highest oil yield among oil seed crops. Malaysia, as the world's second largest producer of palm oil, has 16 % of its lands planted with oil palms. To cope with the ever-increasing global demand on edible oil, additional areas of oil palm are forecasted to increase globally by 12 to 19 million hectares by 2050. Multisensor remote sensing plays an important role by providing relevant, timely and accurate information that can be developed into a plantation monitoring system to optimize production and sustainability. The use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR), a form of microwave remote sensing, in combination with visible and infrared (VIR) data has several distinct advantages, the biggest benefits being daylight and weather independent. SAR produces 'cloud-free' images. However, SAR image are difficult to interpret. Using optical remote sensing provides important physical parameters of the plantation using multispectral data acquisition. Both types of data are complementary and need to be exploited simultaneously to obtain a holistic view on the plantation. Using interferometric SAR a topographical surface and height profiles of oil palm plantations can be derived. The information is crucial in the effort of mapping the oil palms age profile in the country. With this monitored, a replanting program could be effectively installed to maximize national production. VIR remote sensing delivers information on the plants' health and stress along with other biophysical parameters. Therefore the study aims to discover a set of parameters for oil palm plantation monitoring, which are retrievable from multisensor remote sensing data. The parameters are validated through the collection of ground. It is anticipated to derive all relevant information for the oil palm industry to implement a sustainable plantation management. The workflow on the parameter extraction and information derivation is designed and optimized.},

abstract={Nowadays, maritime piracy turns out to be a severe threat for commercial ships, as illustrated by recent events that occurred in Gulfs of Aden and Guinea. Consequently, the design of a fully integrated shipborne self-protection system to counter this treat becomes a requirement. Today's technology allows to equip commercial ships that are sailing in high-risk areas with early detection, dissuasion and protection capabilities to face coordinated attacks from pirates in various scenarios. In this paper, a practical example of a module composed of multiple distributed COTS Infra-Red passive sensors is discussed. It is focused on a 360° close day/night surveillance system around the ship to detect and track these specific threats. The observation module presented hereafter takes advantage of Sagem experience in naval applications and infrared-based surveillance systems. The paper puts forward the detection process (image processing and 3D tracking). The module is planned to be combined with other ones (radar, AIS (Automatic Identification Systems) and electro-optics sensors suites) through a data fusion process in order to provide the ship with a continuous maritime awareness situation from long to very short ranges. The multisensor suite is part of BlueDome, a comprehensive and non-lethal anti-piracy solution developed by the Sagem-led Autoprotection consortium and recently unveiled at the Euromaritime trade show. To conclude, results of detection scenarios are provided. Data have been registered during sea trials dedicated to very short range threats. Results highlight how the module detects and tracks the threats to be targeted. They also demonstrate how module performances are improved by implementing two specific processes: track fusion and features association in tracking process (heuristics assessment). © 2015 SPIE.},

abstract={The term imagery fusion has been used to describe a variety of combining operations performed to increase the ground resolution of multispectral data. The objective of this study was to characterize and evaluate the impact of different pixellevel fusion methods on the accuracy level of land cover/use classification. Panchromatic FORMOSAT-2 data and multispectral SPOT-6 data were considered, and Brovey, Ehlers, and principal component analysis (PCA) algorithms were used as pixel-level fusion algorithms. The improvement in the accuracy of the fused images relative to the original images was determined. The land cover/use categories were classified into five groups by using a maximum likelihood algorithm. To verify and assess the accuracy of classification, training sites were selected for all land cover/use themes. The classification accuracy was calculated for all images by using error matrices. The greatest improvement in land cover/use classification was obtained by using the Brovey algorithm; the overall accuracy was 93.68% and the kappa coefficient was 0.9115. The next greatest improvement was obtained using the Ehlers algorithm, and the overall accuracy and kappa coefficient were 89.54% and 0.8620, respectively. Finally, the least accurate classification was obtained by using the PCA algorithm; the overall accuracy was 88.36% and the kappa coefficient was 0.8247. Comparing the fused images with the original images, the overall accuracy of 86.36% and kappa coefficient value of 0.8036, which were obtained for the original images, were used as benchmarks.},

A global state estimate depends on local state estimates determined by local nodes using local information. Local available information consists of local measurements and k-step delay global information - global estimate sent from a central node. Local estimates are transmitted to the central node to be fused. The synthesis of local and global filters is presented. It is shown that a fusion filtration with k-step delay sharing pattern is equivalent to the optimal centralized classical Kalman filtration when local measurements are transmitted to the center node and used to determine a global state estimate. It is proved that the k-step delay sharing pattern can reduce covariances of local state errors. © Archives of Control Sciences 2015.},

abstract={For the multisensor systems with complex colored noise, using the modern time series analysis, a steady-state optimal and self-tuning Kalman filter weighted by scalars is presented. State augmentation and measurement transformation methods are applied to transform the colored process noise and colored observation noises into white noises. So these problems are transformed to Kalman prediction problems of normal systems with correlated white noises. A steady-state Kalman predictor with complex colored noises is derived on the basis of linear minimum mean square error estimation and fusion criterion weighted by scalars. Then, the filter for original system with colored noises is derived. The precision of the weighted fusion filter is higher than that of the local Kalman filter for every sensor. When the white noise variances are unknown, a self-tuning information fusion Kalman filter weighted by scalars is obtained. A simulation example proves the effectiveness and feasibility of the filtering fusion algorithm. © 2015 Technical Committee on Control Theory, Chinese Association of Automation.},

abstract={Multi-camera photogrammetric systems used in applications such as mobile mapping, vision-aided navigation, biomedical sciences and infrastructure health monitoring have become widespread with the falling cost of solid state sensors and the off-the-shelf availability of digital cameras. These photogrammetric systems require a system calibration, i.e., calibration for both the interior orientation parameters of each camera, and the mounting parameters of each camera with respect to a body frame or a reference camera. The frequency of the system calibration depends on the build quality and on any external factors such as the working environment and the handling of the system components. Since these systems include consumer grade components, which are not necessarily built for engineering applications, the frequency of calibration must be investigated as to avoid extra labour, but at the same time preserve the desired level of precision. This investigation can be achieved through a system stability analysis, where the effects of any changes in the interior or mounting parameters are quantified and compared to a threshold. This paper describes a multi-camera photogrammetric system built for a biomedical application and used in a hospital setting. The system description includes the plausible factors that might cause system instability from one calibration session to another. The system was calibrated (bi-)weekly for the duration of six months. This long term stability analysis data will be analysed in order to decide if the calibration frequency was adequate and also to consult on improving the stability of future system prototypes.},

By studying the theory of multisensory track fusion and signal sparse representation, a sparse representation based multisensory track fusion algorithm is proposed. This new algorithm first obtains a noisy dictionary and a noise-free dictionary by sample tracks. At each scan, the state vectors of local tracks from the same target are rewritten as a vector, and then the sparse representation coefficients of the vector in noisy dictionary are computed. At last, the global state vector at this scan is obtained by the sparse representation coefficients and noise-free dictionary.
