abstract={A reference sensor system, consisting of a multilayer laser scanner and a stereo camera system, is used for detecting vehicle surroundings. Via a novel multi level multi sensor fusion framework the heterogeneous sensor information can be fused on three succeeding processing levels (low, mid and high level). Here the low level fusion achieved the highest accuracy in the description of the object hypotheses. Detection and processing faults can be recognized and reduced by competing sensor information within higher fusion levels. To combine the individual advantages and compensate for the disadvantages of the each level the different levels' results are merged in a V-shaped descent and ascent in the process chain. In the following the framework and the various methods for data fusion are presented and finally validated using real and simulated scenarios.},

abstract={Recently much research has been conducted in visual sensor networks. Compared to traditional sensor networks, vision networks differ in various aspects such as the amount of data to be processed and transmitted, the requirements on quality-of-service, and the level of collaboration among the sensor nodes. This paper deals with sensor fusion on visual sensor networks. We focus here on methods for fusing data from various distributed sensors and present a generic framework for fusion on embedded sensor nodes. This paper extends our previous work on distributed smart cameras and presents our approach toward the transformation of smart cameras into a distributed, embedded multisensor network. Our generic fusion model has been completely implemented on a distributed embedded system. It provides a middleware which supports automatic mapping of our fusion model to the target hardware. This middleware features dynamic reconfiguration to support modification of the fusion application at runtime without loss of sensor data. The feasibility and reusability of the I-SENSE concept is demonstrated with experimental results of two case studies: vehicle classification and bulk good separation. Qualitative and quantitative benefits of multilevel information fusion are outlined in this article.},

title={Collaborative distributed data fusion architecture using multi-level Markov decision processes},
year={2007},
pages={1-8},
abstract={Decentralized multisensor-multitarget tracking has numerous advantages over single-sensor or single-platform tracking. In this paper, we present a solution to one of the main problems of decentralized tracking, namely, distributed information transfer and fusion among the participating platforms. This paper presents a hierarchial multi-level decision mechanism for collaborative distributed data fusion that provides each platform with the required data for the fusion process while substantially reducing redundancy in the information flow in the overall system. We consider a distributed data fusion system consisting of platforms that are decentralized, heterogenous, and potentially unreliable. The proposed approach, which is based on hierarchial Markov decision processes and decentralized lookup substrate, will control the information exchange and data fusion process based, among the other parameters, on maximizing performance metrics of individual platforms, thereby enhancing the whole distributed system's reliability as well as that of each participating platform. Simulation examples demonstrate the operation and the performance results of the system.},

title={Multi Level Fusion with Fuzzy Operators using Confidence},
year={2006},
pages={1-6},
abstract={The paper presents a methodology for using fuzzy operators for the hierarchical fusion of processing results in a multi sensor data processing system. Tracking and fusion of intermediate results is performed in several levels of processing (signal level, several feature levels, object level). To produce higher level hypotheses on the basis of lower level components, grouping rules using certain assignment decisions are used. In this paper this is seen as a classification procedure that is step by step testing and assigning components to a higher level feature or object. For these classifications a suitable combination of a fuzzy operator for fusion and membership functions for classification is proposed to meet the requirements of the hierarchical classification and the necessity to include confidence values for that. Especially the dependencies between the n-fold one-dimensional classification and the n-dimensional classification is addressed. We use a straightforward example to demonstrate the concept of the multi level fusion and classification procedure},
