abstract = "Abstract Intelligent transportation system (ITS) infrastructures contain sensors, data processing, and communication technologies that assist in improving passenger safety, reducing travel time and fuel consumption, and decreasing incident detection time. Multisource data from BluetoothÂ® and IP-based (cellular and Wi-Fi) communications, global positioning system (GPS) devices, cell phones, probe vehicles, license plate readers, infrastructure-based traffic-flow sensors, and in the future, connected vehicles enable multisource data fusion to be exploited to produce an enhanced interpretation of the monitored or observed situation. This occurs by decreasing the uncertainty present in individual source data. Although demonstrated for more than two decades, data fusion (DF) is still an emergent field as related to day-to-day traffic management operations. Data fusion techniques applied to date include Bayesian inference, Dempster-Shafer evidential reasoning, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, and Kalman filtering. This paper provides a survey of \{ITS\} \{DF\} applications, including ramp metering, pedestrian crossing, automatic incident detection, travel time prediction, adaptive signal control, and crash analysis and prevention, and indicates directions for future research. The encouraging results so far should not conceal the challenges that remain before widespread operational deployment of \{DF\} in transportation management occurs. "

It is specifically designed for unknown systems in uncertain and inconsistent conditions. However, it can also be applied for known and exact sources. When the sources contain uncertainty and inconsistency, data fusion may fail. The proposed method can recognize and remove the inconsistent data points and produces reliable results.

For air defence applications, the target information from multi sensors is sent to a central control centre to create a complete threat scenario which would be used for taking appropriate decision. This target data needs to be sent in real time, hence there is a need for low bandwidth consuming data fusion algorithms but at the same time there should be minimal degradation in data accuracy. The optimal fusion algorithm requires the entire state covariance information matrix to be transmitted to the data fusion centre, however this requires huge bandwidth for transmission of data. To avoid this generally, only diagonal elements are transmitted at the cost of considerable degradation in performance. The authors present an innovative approach by considering the only covariance of position, velocity and acceleration but by neglecting the cross covariance terms among position, velocity and acceleration. The accuracy of this proposed algorithm is about 95% of that of optimal method but the reduction in bandwidth requirement is of the order of 60%. "

The optimality of most detection fusion rules implemented in these systems relies on the knowledge of probability distributions for all distributed sensors. The overall detection performance of the central processor is often worse than expected due to instabilities of the sensors probability density functions. This paper proposes a new multiple decisions fusion rule for targets detection in distributed multiple sensor systems with data fusion. Unlike the published studies, in which the overall decision is based on single binary decision from each individual sensor and requires the knowledge of the sensors probability distributions, the proposed fusion method derives the overall decision based on multiple decisions from each individual sensor assuming that the probability distributions are not known. Therefore, the proposed fusion rule is insensitive to instabilities of the sensors probability distributions. The proposed multiple decisions fusion rule is derived and its overall performance is evaluated. Comparisons with the performance of single sensor, optimum hard detection, optimum centralized detection, and a multiple thresholds decision fusion, are also provided. The results show that the proposed multiple decisions fusion rule has higher performance than the optimum hard detection and the multiple thresholds detection systems. Thus it reduces the loss in performance between the optimum centralized detection and the optimum hard detection systems. Extension of the proposed method to the case of target detection when some probability density functions are known and applications to binary communication systems are also addressed. "

These give us some new insights on fusing preferences given by persons having different perspectives (e.g., economical, technical, environmental, etc.), including decision-makers, and aimed to be suitable for different organizational structures (e.g., multilevel structures). Herein, a proper representation is needed to merge preferences from each perspective, enabling their propagation, throughout an organizational structure until the level in which a decision is made. This representation is presented as a decision-making unit (DMU), and is used as the primary component of our decision-making model. In this paper, we propose a novel decision-making model that recursively merges the preferred criteria from different \{DMUs\} using the logic scoring of preference (LSP) method. An illustrative example demonstrating the applicability of the proposed model, in the context of a new product design, is included in the paper. "

An autonomous vehicle control system framework is proposed to dissect an automotive system into some sub-systems in which physical systems and control softwares are communicating. To attain robustness, a robust on-road vehicle localization scheme is proposed applying multi sensor-data fusion with the results of multirate decentralized state estimation and the clothoidal road model constraint. Control block and control block topology are proposed to utilize block-wise perception of environment and vehicle localization and to produce a trajectory command via a virtual lane curve for longitudinal/lateral vehicle control. To attain real-time control optimality, we apply the multilevel approximate predictive control developed by the authors. Performance of the proposed autonomous driving control system is demonstrated through some track test results. "

In this paper, a novel thresholding algorithm based on 3D Otsu and multi-scale image representation is proposed for medical image segmentation. Considering the high time complexity of 3D Otsu algorithm, an acceleration variant is invented using dimension decomposition rule. In order to reduce the effects of noises and weak edges, multi-scale image representation is brought into the segmentation algorithm. The whole segmentation algorithm is designed as an iteration procedure. In each iteration, the image is segmented by the efficient 3D Otsu, and then it is filtered by a fast local Laplacian filtering to get a smoothed image which will be input into the next iteration. Finally, the segmentation results are pooled to get a final segmentation using majority voting rules. The attractive features of the algorithm are that its segmentation results are stable, it is robust to noises and it holds for both bi-level and multi-level thresholding cases. Experiments on medical \{MR\} brain images are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm is superior to the other multilevel thresholding algorithms consistently. "

abstract = "Abstract Digital images are facing a crisis of trustworthiness with the emergence of various digital image processing and steganography tools. This paper proposes a novel approach that can evaluate the trustworthiness of a digital image. In this approach, an information fusion method is used to combine base digital image forensic models at the feature level and the decision level. When using different kinds of base forensic models to get supporting evidence for different kinds of digital image manipulations, there exist uncertainties introduced by base forensic models and conflicts among evidence provided by different forensic models. We use the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory and an improved least square method to tolerate the uncertainties of forensic models and reduce the evidence conflicts. The lower and upper limits of digital image trustworthiness can then be reliably evaluated by the D-S theory. Three information fusion models based on the D-S theory are proposed. The first model uses the D-S theory at the feature fusion level. The second uses the D-S theory at the decision fusion level, where an improved least square method is designed to reduce the evidence conflicts. The last model is a combination of the first and the second one, where the D-S theory is applied at both the feature fusion and decision fusion levels. Experiments are carried out on four kinds of digital image manipulations. The experimental results show that the three proposed models are very stable in evaluating different kinds of natural images and tampering images. While the first model can only give the upper limit of the trustworthiness of a digital image, the second and the third one can give both lower and upper limits of the trustworthiness of a digital image, as well as the uncertainties of the evidence produced by base forensics models. Compared with the second model, the third one can further reduce the uncertainties. The experimental results also show that when a digital image undergoes many kinds of manipulations, our models can validly compute a soft degree to measure the trustworthiness of the image, while current ordinary digital image forensic models may fail to predict it correctly. Experimental results also demonstrate that the proposed digital image trustworthiness evaluation models can be adapted as digital image forensic classification models with very high detection accuracy.

This is very important for both of the \{WSNs\} and the big data framework. For the WSNs, the in-network pre-processing techniques could lead to saving in their limited resources. For the big data side, receiving a clean, non-redundant and relevant data would reduce the excessive data volume, thus an overload reduction will be obtained at the big data processing platforms and the discovery of values from these data will be accelerated.

abstract = "Abstract In intelligence analysis a situation of interest is commonly obscured by the more voluminous amount of unimportant data. This data can be broadly divided into two categories, hard or physical sensor data and soft or human observed data. Soft intelligence data is collected by humans through human interaction, or human intelligence (HUMINT). The value and difficulty in manual processing of these observations due to the volume of available data and cognitive limitations of intelligence analysts necessitate an information fusion approach toward their understanding. The data representation utilized in this work is an attributed graphical format. The uncertainties, size and complexity of the connections within this graph make accurate assessments difficult for the intelligence analyst. While this graphical form is easier to consider for an intelligence analyst than disconnected multi-source human and sensor reports, manual traversal for the purpose of obtaining situation awareness and accurately answering priority information requests (PIRs) is still infeasible. To overcome this difficulty an automated stochastic graph matching approach is developed. This approach consists of three main processes: uncertainty alignment, graph matching result initialization and graph matching result maintenance. Uncertainty alignment associates with raw incoming observations a bias adjusted uncertainty representation representing the true value containing spread of the observation. The graph matching initialization step provides template graph to data graph matches for a newly initialized situation of interest (template graph). Finally, the graph matching result maintenance algorithm continuously updates graph matching results as incoming observations augment the cumulative data graph. Throughout these processes the uncertainties present in the original observations and the template to data graph matches are preserved, ultimately providing an indication of the uncertainties present in the current situation assessment. In addition to providing the technical details of this approach, this paper also provides an extensive numerical testing section which indicates a significant performance improvement of the proposed algorithm over a leading commercial solver.

Time-lapse \{GPR\} and \{FDR\} measurements were conducted weekly during the period 23/03â08/06/2011 along a cultivated hillslope in the Belgian loam belt. A full-wave \{GPR\} model, a soil dielectric mixing model and the Debye equation were combined to directly estimate soil moisture from \{GPR\} measurements. Measured \{GPR\} data were well reproduced by the full-wave \{GPR\} model, resulting in a relatively good agreement between the \{GPR\} and FDR-derived soil moisture. Subsequently, we merged the soil moisture obtained from both techniques in a data fusion framework and we investigated its spatial and temporal variability. The results indicate that there was a high correlation between the spatial variability of soil moisture and topography as well as between its temporal variability and rainfall. A temporal stability analysis showed that soil moisture at the footslope is higher and more stable than that at the summits and backslopes. The proposed approach appears to be promising for assessing soil moisture at the hillslope scale with a relatively high spaceâtime resolution. "

An effective state estimation algorithm based on data fusion is presented. Because sampling rate of infrared detection system is much higher than that of the laser detection system, the theory of multi-scale analysis is used to establish multi-scale model in this algorithm. At the fine scale, angle information provided by infrared detection system is used to estimate the target state through the unscented Kalman filter. It makes full use of the high frequency characteristic of infrared detection system to improve target state estimation accuracy. At the coarse scale, due to the sampling ratio of infrared and laser detection systems is an integer multiple, the angle information can be fused directly with the distance information of laser detection system to determine the target location. The fused information is served as observation, while the converted measurement Kalman filter (CMKF) is used to estimate the target state, which greatly reduces the complexity of filtering process and gets the optimal fusion estimation. The simulation results of tracking a target in 3-D space by infrared and laser detection systems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in this paper is efficient and can obtain better performance than traditional algorithm.

Unlike previously published rules, the proposed combining rule fuses soft decisions of sensors rather than hard decisions of sensors and does not require the knowledge of the false alarm and detection probabilities of the distributed sensors. Such a fusion rule is adaptive, insensitive to the instabilities of the sensor thresholds, and has the advantage of soft decision fusion. The proposed combination rule is derived: (1) for the case where the fusion center estimates the error probabilities of the sensors and (2) for the case where the fusion center does not estimate the error probabilities of the sensors. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated, and illustrative examples are presented in the cases of Gaussian and Rayleigh distributed observations. Comparisons with the optimum centralized fusion, the optimum soft decision fusion, a soft decision fusion approach based on fusing confidence levels, and the optimum decentralized hard decision fusion are also presented. The results indicate that the proposed approach significantly outperforms the optimum decentralized hard decision fusion, is better than the approach based on fusing confidence levels, and has a performance similar to that of the optimum soft decision fusion.

To substantiate and generalise the postulated temporal effects on glare response, a semi-controlled study was set up in a test room with direct access to daylight and to an external view. Forty participants gave glare sensation votes at three times of day, randomised over different days, while engaging with visual tasks under two shading conditions. Self-assessments of several temporal variables â fatigue, hunger, caffeine intake, mood, prior light exposure, sky condition â were provided by test subjects with their glare assessments. A multilevel statistical analysis of the data â considering factors that were experimentally manipulated (fixed effects) and variables that changed over time (random effects) â confirmed a statistically significant and practically relevant effect of time of day on subjective evaluations of glare sensation. The influences detected showed a tendency towards an increasing tolerance to discomfort from daylight glare as the day progresses. In addition, the variances associated with temporal variables were found to partially confound the effect of time of day on glare response. The results from this study substantiate previous laboratory findings and support the conclusion that the conventional physical and photometric parameters utilised in glare indices and formulae might not be sufficient to consistently describe and predict the occurrence and magnitude of discomfort glare from natural and artificial lighting.

Shift sensitivity, lack of phase information and poor directionality of real valued wavelet transforms motivated us to use complex wavelet transform for fusion. We have used Daubechies complex wavelet transform (DCxWT) for image fusion which is approximately shift invariant and provides phase information. In the present work, we have proposed a new multimodal medical image fusion using \{DCxWT\} at multiple levels which is based on multiresolution principle. The proposed method fuses the complex wavelet coefficients of source images using maximum selection rule. Experiments have been performed over three different sets of multimodal medical images. The proposed fusion method is visually and quantitatively compared with wavelet domain (Dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), Lifting wavelet transform (LWT), Multiwavelet transform (MWT), Stationary wavelet transform (SWT)) and spatial domain (Principal component analysis (PCA), linear and sharp) image fusion methods. The proposed method is further compared with Contourlet transform (CT) and Nonsubsampled contourlet transform (NSCT) based image fusion methods. For comparison of the proposed method, we have used five fusion metrics, namely entropy, edge strength, standard deviation, fusion factor and fusion symmetry. Comparison results prove that performance of the proposed fusion method is better than any of the above existing fusion methods. Robustness of the proposed method is tested against Gaussian, salt &amp; pepper and speckle noise and the plots of fusion metrics for different noise cases established the superiority of the proposed fusion method.

Facial Action Coding System (FACS), which describes all possible facial expressions based on a set of facial muscle movements called Action Unit (AU), has been used extensively to model and analyze facial expressions. \{FACS\} describes methods for coding the intensity of AUs, and \{AU\} intensity measurement is important in some studies in behavioral science and developmental psychology. However, in majority of the existing studies in the area of facial expression recognition, the focus has been on basic expression recognition or facial action unit detection. There are very few investigations on measuring the intensity of spontaneous facial actions. In addition, the few studies on \{AU\} intensity recognition usually try to measure the intensity of facial actions statically and individually, ignoring the dependencies among multilevel \{AU\} intensities as well as the temporal information. However, these spatiotemporal interactions among facial actions are crucial for understanding and analyzing spontaneous facial expressions, since these coherent, coordinated, and synchronized interactions are that produce a meaningful facial display. In this paper, we propose a framework based on Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) to systematically model the dynamic and semantic relationships among multilevel \{AU\} intensities. Given the extracted image observations, the \{AU\} intensity recognition is accomplished through probabilistic inference by systematically integrating the image observations with the proposed \{DBN\} model. Experiments on Denver Intensity of Spontaneous Facial Action (DISFA) database demonstrate the superiority of our method over single image-driven methods in \{AU\} intensity measurement. "

However, automatic \{AC\} segmentation and 3D reconstruction from hydrogen-based \{MR\} images alone is challenging because of inhomogeneous intensities, shape irregularity, and low contrast existing in the cartilage region. Thus, the objective of this research was to provide an insight into morphologic assessment of \{AC\} using multilevel data processing of multinuclear (23Na and 1H) \{MR\} knee images. Materials and Methods A dual-tuned (23Na and 1H) radio-frequency coil with 1.5-TÂ MR scanner is used to scan four human subjects using two separate \{MR\} pulse sequences for the respective sodium and proton imaging of the knee. Postprocessing is performed using customized routines written in MATLAB. \{MR\} data were fused to improve contrast of the cartilage region that is further used for automatic segmentation. Marching cubes algorithm is applied on the segmented \{AC\} slices for 3D volume rendering and volume is then calculated using the divergence theorem. Results Fusion of multinuclear \{MR\} images results in an improved contrast (factor &gt;3) in the cartilage region. Sensitivity (80.21%) and specificity (99.64%) analysis performed by comparing manually segmented \{AC\} shows a good performance of the automated \{AC\} segmentation. The average cartilage volume (23.19Â Â±Â 1.38 cm3; coefficient of variation [COV] â0.059) measured from 3D \{AC\} models of four data sets shows a marked improvement over average cartilage volume (23.24Â cm3; \{COV\} â0.19) reported earlier.

But as nodes in \{VANETs\} have very high mobility, so there are lots of challenges to route the packets to their final destination which need to be addressed by existing/proposing new solutions for the same. Keeping in view of the above, this paper provides a detailed description of various existing routing techniques in literature with an aim of selecting a particular strategy depending upon its applicability in a particular application. A detailed categorization of various routing techniques is provided in the paper with critical discussion on each categorization with respect to its advantages, disadvantages, various constraints and applications.

In recent years, the advances in information technologies have led to more complex road safety applications able to cope with a high variety of situations. These applications have strong sensing requirements that a single sensor, with the available technology, cannot attain. Recent researches in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) try to overcome the limitations of the sensors by combining them. But not only sensor information is crucial to give a good and robust representation of the road environment; context information has a key role for reliable safety applications to provide reliable detection and complete situation assessment. This paper presents a novel approach for pedestrian detection using sensor fusion of laser scanner and computer vision. The application also takes advantage of context information, providing danger estimation for the pedestrians detected. Closing the loop, the danger estimation is later used, together with context information, as feedback to enhance the pedestrian detection process. "

In this paper, the problem of mapping unknown environments by a team of heterogeneous mobile robots with limited and inexpensive sensing abilities is addressed. The concepts of Information Space and sensor models have been employed to plan the motions of robots with limited sensory data in order to accomplish the common goal of mapping the entire workspace as complete as possible. Also, a cooperation architecture is proposed to fuse and interrelate the dissimilar data obtained by individual heterogeneous robots and allocate various exploratory tasks to each of them in order to complete the map. The algorithm works with various limited sensing models, such as depth-limited boundary distance sensor, quadridirectional depth sensor, depth-limited gap sensor, and depth-limited radially-bounded depth senor. Based on each sensor model, the best moving strategy is introduced to maximize the workspace coverage for each robot. The proposed algorithm, which yields a geometric map of the environment, is implemented in diverse simulated problems both with and without sensing noises, and the results and comparisons with a recent related work show that it is able to reliably construct maps of simply-connected and multiply-connected environments with convex and concave obstacles. In the presence of noises, the produced maps had about 12.4% false positive and 3.3% false negative errors on average. Also, some sensitivity analyses are done on the effects of workspace size and number of robots on the mapping time. "

The multimodal physiological signals are: Electroencephalogram (EEG) (32 channels) and peripheral (8 channels: Galvanic skin response (GSR), blood volume pressure, respiration pattern, skin temperature, electromyogram (EMG) and electrooculogram (EOG)) as given in the \{DEAP\} database. We have discussed the theories of emotion modeling based on i) basic emotions, ii) cognitive appraisal and physiological response approach and iii) the dimensional approach and proposed a three continuous dimensional representation model for emotions. The clustering experiment on the given valence, arousal and dominance values of various emotions has been done to validate the proposed model. A novel approach for multimodal fusion of information from a large number of channels to classify and predict emotions has also been proposed. Discrete Wavelet Transform, a classical transform for multiresolution analysis of signal has been used in this study. The experiments are performed to classify different emotions from four classifiers. The average accuracies are 81.45%, 74.37%, 57.74% and 75.94% for SVM, MLP, \{KNN\} and \{MMC\} classifiers respectively. The best accuracy is for âDepressingâ with 85.46% using SVM. The 32 \{EEG\} channels are considered as independent modes and features from each channel are considered with equal importance. May be some of the channel data are correlated but they may contain supplementary information. In comparison with the results given by others, the high accuracy of 85% with 13 emotions and 32 subjects from our proposed method clearly proves the potential of our multimodal fusion approach. "

In cooperation with different fitting models, these four weighted fusion methods can be applied to a range of measurement challenges. The experimental results of this study show that the four weighted fusion methods compose a computationally efficient and reliable system for multi-sensor measurement problems, especially for freeform surface measurement. A comparison of weighted fusion with residual approximation-based fusion has also been conducted by providing the input datasets with different noise levels and sample sizes. The results demonstrated that weighted fusion and residual approximation-based fusion are complementary approaches applicable to most fusion scenarios. "

Firstly, the joint statistics and mutual information of the \{PDTDFB\} coefficients are studied. Then, the \{PDTDFB\} coefficients are modeled using a \{HMT\} model with Gaussian mixtures, which can effectively capture the intra-scale, inter-scale, and inter-direction dependencies. Finally, a color image segmentation using \{PDTDFB\} domain \{HMT\} model is developed, in which expectationâmaximization (EM) parameter estimation, Bayesian multiscale raw segmentation, context based multiscale fusion, and majority-vote based color component fusion are used. Experimental evidence shows that the proposed color image segmentation algorithm has very effective segmentation results in comparison with the state-of-the-art segmentation methods recently proposed in the literature.

Within this study, the performance of several programs, representing common virtual screening methods, was compared in a prospective manner. First, we selected top-ranked virtual screening hits from the three methods pharmacophore modeling, shape-based modeling, and docking. For comparison, these hits were then additionally predicted by external pharmacophore- and 2D similarity-based bioactivity profiling tools. Subsequently, the biological activities of the selected hits were assessed inÂ vitro, which allowed for evaluating and comparing the prospective performance of the applied tools. Although all methods performed well, considerable differences were observed concerning hit rates, true positive and true negative hits, and hitlist composition. Our results suggest that a rational selection of the applied method represents a powerful strategy to maximize the success of a research project, tightly linked to its aims. We employed cyclooxygenase as application example, however, the focus of this study lied on highlighting the differences in the virtual screening tool performances and not in the identification of novel COX-inhibitors.

This article describes the Baquara2 framework to help narrow this gap by exploiting knowledge bases to semantically enrich and analyze movement data. It provides an ontological model for structuring and abstracting movement data in a multilevel hierarchy of progressively detailed movement segments that generalize concepts such as trajectories, stops, and moves. Baquara2 also includes a general customizable process to annotate movement data with concepts and objects described in ontologies and Linked Open Data (LOD) collections. The resulting semantic annotations enable queries for movement analyses based on application and domain specific knowledge. The proposed framework has been used in experiments to semantically enrich movement data collected from social media with geo-referenced LOD. The obtained results enable powerful queries that illustrate Baquara2 capabilities. "

In the proposed architecture the local regions contain disjoint sets of data and for this data only the most similar features are selected. The pairwise squared correlations of the features are used to weight the predictions of the ensemble's models.

In this paper, a population is synthesized for individuals and households in Atlantic Canada using the Fitness Based Synthesis (FBS) approach. A synthetic algorithm is designed that allows both individual and household attribute levels to synthesize simultaneously. Unequal probabilities based on the sampling weight are used in the household selection step of the algorithm. In this way, the performance and accuracy of the synthetic population produced has been improved. The synthetic algorithm is tested for two functions: first, using the one level (household) control tables; and second, using two levels (individual and household) control tables. The data used in this study is collected from the 2006 Canadian Census and the 2006 Public Use Micro-data File (PUMF). The algorithm is implemented using a high-level matrix programming language for numerical computation in MATLAB. The results show that the synthetic population with both individual and household level attributes has the best fitness value. "

Forty-five synthetic populations were generated for 12 census tracts in Florida for this purpose. The empirical results indicate the value of synthesizing base-year populations more accurately by accommodating multi-level controls. Although fewer controls are typically available for target years, the use of multi-level controls in the target year with appropriate synthesis methods does benefit the accuracy of the synthetic population. This study also establishes that the magnitude of the overall error in the synthesized population appears to be linearly related to the magnitude of the input errors introduced via the control tables. The improvements in accuracy are statistically significant and hold after controlling for differences in population sizes and growth rates for the different census tracts. Overall, efforts to accurately synthesize base-year populations and to good forecasts of target-year controls can help synthesize accurate target-year populations. "

It becomes vitally important to ensure that cloud services can be acceptable to more potential users. However, it is challenging for potential users to discover the trustworthy cloud services due to the deficiency of usage experiences and the information overload of QoE (quality of experience) evaluations from consumers. This paper presents a user feature-aware trustworthiness measurement approach for potential users. In this approach, the influence factors of QoE are systematically analyzed based on the user feature model and the quantitative computation methods are designed to measure the user feature similarity. In addition, employing \{FAHP\} (fuzzy analytic hierarchy process) method identifies the user feature community. To enhance the accuracy of trustworthiness measurement, the false evidences in QoE evaluations are iteratively filtered out with dynamic mean distance threshold. Finally, the trustworthiness of service is measured via evidence synthesis combining user feature similarity. The experiments show that this approach is effective to improve the quality of trustworthiness measurement, which is helpful to solve information overload problem and cold start problem of trusted service recommendation for potential users.

With one or more tuning parameters, using only one measure of model quality to select final tuning parameter values is not sufficient. Optimization of several model quality measures is challenging. Thus, three fusion ranking methods are investigated for simultaneous assessment of multiple measures of model quality for selecting tuning parameter values. One is a supervised learning fusion rule named sum of ranking differences (SRD). The other two are non-supervised learning processes based on the sum and median operations. The effect of the number of models evaluated on the three fusion rules are also evaluated using three procedures. One procedure uses all models from all possible combinations of the tuning parameters. To reduce the number of models evaluated, an iterative process (only applicable to SRD) is applied and thresholding a model quality measure before applying the fusion rules is also used. A near infrared pharmaceutical data set requiring model updating is used to evaluate the three fusion rules. In this case, calibration of the primary conditions is for the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) of tablets produced in a laboratory. The secondary conditions for calibration updating is for tablets produced in the full batch setting. Two model updating processes requiring selection of two unique tuning parameter values are studied. One is based on Tikhonov regularization (TR) and the other is a variation of partial least squares (PLS). The three fusion methods are shown to provide equivalent and acceptable results allowing automatic selection of the tuning parameter values. Best tuning parameter values are selected when model quality measures used with the fusion rules are for the small secondary sample set used to form the updated models. In this model updating situation, evaluation of all possible models, thresholding, and iterative \{SRD\} performed equivalently for the three fusion rules with \{TR\} and \{PLS\} performed worse. While the application is model updating, the fusion processes are applicable to other situations requiring selection of multiple tuning parameter values. "

A four-stage methodology for SHM, based on machine learning is discussed. The different levels of diagnostic information available depend on the type of data available for learning and this is also discussed. Detection alone can be carried out using normal condition data only and this is achieved using supervised learning where detection thresholds are critical. If damage state data are available, supervised learning can be applied and more diagnostic information becomes available. The various concepts are discussed in terms of a number of case studies drawn from wind turbine monitoring programmes; this allows the illustration of both \{SHM\} methods and machine condition monitoring methods. The possibility of moving towards a population-based approach to \{SHM\} applicable to systems-of-systems is outlined via one of the case studies. "

How to mine the information of these data has attracted a great interest in data mining. But sequence data is easily interfered and produces some fluctuant points. When dealing with these sequences, traditional sequence similarity measurement such as Euclidean distance arises large error, especially for unequal length fluctuant sequence. A novel average weight 1-norm unequal length fluctuant sequence similarity measurement algorithm based on dynamic time warping (DTW) is proposed to solve this problem. It constructs an absolute distance matrix based on \{DTW\} firstly, then weight average weight 1-norm and modify it with modifying factor to measure the distance of unequal length fluctuant sequence. It solves the fluctuation sensitivity of maximum distance measurement algorithm. Finally transform distance to similarity as the index of the association, associate the sequence data according to the maximum similarity association rule. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm when associating unequal length fluctuant sequence, association rate is above 70% and simulate the effect of variation of the sequence length, fluctuant rate and processing time to the proposed algorithm.

To overcome these constraints, we explore the ecosystem metaphor for \{WSNs\} with the aim of taking advantage of the efficient adaptation behavior and strong communication mechanisms used by living organisms. While mapping these organisms onto sensors and ecosystems onto WSNs, we identify the similarities of both parties in terms of structure, active entities, topology, goals, communications, and functions and highlight shortcomings that would prevent \{WSNs\} from matching the behavior of ecosystems. We then propose an agent-based architecture that migrates the complex processing loads outside the physical sensor network while incorporating missing characteristics such as autonomy, intelligence, and context awareness to the WSN. In contrast to existing works, we use software agents to bridge the gap between \{WSNs\} and natural ecosystems and achieve an optimal mapping between both systems. Our ultimate goal is to enhance the capabilities of \{WSNs\} to take advantage of ecology-inspired algorithms. "

However, neither the simulation process nor the \{DRI\} gives any consideration to uncertainties in drought events. Therefore, the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory and the evidential reasoning algorithm were introduced, and the \{DRI\} values were calculated with consideration of uncertainties of the three indices.

Specifically, in this paper we propose a distributed solution to the problem of reconstructing target positions in large Motion Capture (MoCap) systems. Real time reconstruction by means of centralized procedures is practically unfeasible for very large systems, while the use of distributed computation allows to significantly reduce the computational time required for reconstruction, thus allowing the development of real time solutions. Then the proposed distributed reconstruction procedure is optimized by exploiting information about the structure of the system: the visibility matrix states which objects in the scene are somehow measurable by a sensor (sensor-object matrix). Often, the typical localization of data from real application scenarios induces an underlying structure on the visibility matrix, that can be exploited to improve the performance of the system in understanding the surrounding environment. Unfortunately, usually these data are not properly organized in the visibility matrix: for instance, listing the sensors in a pseudo-random order can hide the underlying structure of the matrix. This paper considers the problem of recovering such underlying structure directly from the visibility matrix and designs an algorithm to perform this task. Our simulations show that the distributed reconstruction algorithm optimized by means of the estimation of the structure of the visibility matrix achieves an important computational time reduction with respect to the standard (centralized) reconstruction algorithm.

However, extending the \{EMD\} to its three-dimensional (3D) version remains a challenging task due to the enormous computational effort. In this paper, we propose a fast 3D \{EMD\} (TEMD) to decompose a volume into several 3D intrinsic mode functions (TIMFs). Two strategies are introduced to accelerate the TEMD. On the one hand, the distances among extrema, which can be used to identify the filter sizes, are effectively calculated by 3D Delaunay triangulation (DT). On the other hand, separable filters are adopted to generate the envelopes. Rather than performing a 3D filter, we separately apply a one-dimensional (1D) filter three times to obtain the same results with much less computational requirements. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed \{TEMD\} method significantly speeds up the calculation and yields improved decomposition performance on synthetic and real world data. "

These infrastructures may suffer from faults/malfunctions coming e.g. from aging effects or they may even comprise targets of terrorist attacks. Prompt detection and accommodation of these situations is of paramount significance. This paper proposes a probabilistic modeling scheme for analyzing malicious events appearing in interdependent critical infrastructures. The proposed scheme is based on modeling the relationship between datastreams coming from two network nodes by means of a hidden Markov model (HMM) trained on the parameters of linear time-invariant dynamic systems which estimate the relationships existing among the specific nodes over consecutive time windows. Our study includes an energy network (IEEE 30 model bus) operated via a telecommunications infrastructure. The relationships among the elements of the network of infrastructures are represented by an \{HMM\} and the novel data is categorized according to its distance (computed in the probabilistic space) from the training ones. We considered two types of cyber-attacks (denial of service and integrity/replay) and report encouraging results in terms of false positive rate, false negative rate and detection delay. "

In WSNs, deployment of sensor nodes (SN) may be random, or it may follow an optimized approach-based upon the application in which it is to be used. Energy efficient route selection for transferring data from a \{SN\} to the base station (BS) is the key issue to increase the lifetime of WSN. Therefore, hierarchical cluster-based data transmission from a \{SN\} to \{BS\} using multi-hop communication can be one of the effective solutions, as the transmission operation consumes more energy compared to sensing or computation. Several mechanisms have been proposed in the literature for an improvement of network lifetime. Motivated from the above, in this paper, we propose a Distance-Based Multihop Clustering and Routing (DB-MCR) protocol for heterogeneous environment to improve stability, and network lifetime of WSNs. By fixing the node densities, network region is segmented into different subregions with a specific shape. Boundaries of the segmented regions are estimated using the node densities. Segment-wise data transmissions are used for data collection at \{BS\} which provides separate bands for the nodes in different regions. A distance-based algorithm is used for election of cluster heads (CH) in which a weighted election probability (WEP) is computed to reduce the interference among the nodes. The performance of the proposed scheme is evaluated using extensive simulations with respect to network lifetime, and stability. The results obtained at initial energy E 0 = 0.25 J with \{BS\} located at corner show that DB-MCR improves the lifetime by 13% &amp; 17%, and stability by 8% &amp; 16% in comparison to \{MCR\} and \{SEP\} respectively.

It is mainly classified into dry and wet type. Dry \{AMD\} is most common among elderly people. At present there is no treatment available for dry AMD. Early diagnosis and treatment to the affected eye may reduce the progression of disease. Manual screening of fundus images is time consuming and subjective. Hence in this study we are proposing an Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD)-based nonlinear feature extraction to characterize and classify normal and \{AMD\} fundus images. \{EMD\} is performed on 1D Radon Transform (RT) projections to generate different Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMF). Various nonlinear features are extracted from the IMFs. The dimensionality of the extracted features are reduced using Locality Sensitive Discriminant Analysis (LSDA). Then the reduced \{LSDA\} features are ranked using minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR), KullbackâLeibler Divergence (KLD) and Chernoff Bound and Bhattacharyya Distance (CBBD) techniques. Ranked \{LSDA\} components are sequentially fed to Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate normal and \{AMD\} classes. The performance of the current study is experimented using private and two public datasets namely Automated Retinal Image Analysis (ARIA) and \{STructured\} Analysis of the Retina (STARE). The 10-fold cross validation approach is used to evaluate the performance of the classifiers and obtained highest average classification accuracy of 100%, sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 100% for \{STARE\} dataset using only two ranked \{LSDA\} components.

In particular, this model encompasses networks with the characteristics of small-world networks. Using only about 3% of high-end sensors, and deploying nodes by using the slightly attractive model defined herein, we observe improved characteristics of the network topology, such as: (i) low average path length, (ii) high clustering coefficient, and (iii) improved relay task distribution among sensors. We also provide a guide for deploying nodes in order to improve the network lifetime, showing that the aforementioned model can be used to diminish the energy hole effect. Moreover, we evaluate a topological metric, namely Sink Betweenness, suitable for characterizing the relay task of a node. "

That is, while drawdowns due to pumping continue to grow, the hydraulic gradient in the vicinity of the pumping well does not change significantly. These conditions have built upon two-dimensional and equivalent homogeneous conceptual models, but few field data have been available to affirm the existence of these conditions. Moreover, effects of heterogeneity and three-dimensional flow on this quasi-steady state concept have not been thoroughly investigated and discussed before. In this study, we first present a quantitative definition of quasi-steady state (or steady-shape conditions) and steady state conditions based on the analytical solution of two- or three-dimensional flow induced by pumping in unbounded, homogeneous aquifers. Afterward, we use a stochastic analysis to investigate the influence of heterogeneity on the quasi-steady state concept in heterogeneous aquifers. The results of the analysis indicate that the time to reach an approximate quasi-steady state in a heterogeneous aquifer could be quite different from that estimated based on a homogeneous model. We find that heterogeneity of aquifer properties, especially hydraulic conductivity, impedes the development of the quasi-steady state condition before the flow reaching steady state. Finally, 280 drawdown-time data from the hydraulic tomographic survey conducted at a field site corroborate our finding that the quasi-steady state condition likely would not take place in heterogeneous aquifers unless pumping tests last a long period. Research significance (1) Approximate quasi-steady and steady state conditions are defined for two- or three-dimensional flow induced by pumping in unbounded, equivalent homogeneous aquifers. (2) Analysis demonstrates effects of boundary condition, well screen interval, and heterogeneity of parameters on the existence of the quasi-steady, and validity of approximate quasi-steady concept. (3) Temporal evaluation of information content about heterogeneity in head observations are analyzed in heterogeneous aquifer. (4) 280 observed drawdown-time data corroborate the stochastic analysis that quasi-steady is difficult to reach in highly heterogeneous aquifers. "

Two main families of population synthesis techniques can be distinguished: (a) fitting methods (iterative proportional fitting, updating) and (b) combinatorial optimization methods. During the last few years, a third outperforming family of population synthesis procedures has emerged, i.e., Markov process-based methods such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) simulations. In this paper, an extended Hidden Markov Model (HMM)-based approach is presented, which can serve as a better alternative than the existing methods. The approach is characterized by a great flexibility and efficiency in terms of data preparation and model training. The \{HMM\} is able to reproduce the structural configuration of a given population from an unlimited number of micro-samples and a marginal distribution. Only one marginal distribution of the considered population can be used as a boundary condition to âguideâ the synthesis of the whole population. Model training and testing are performed using the Survey on the Workforce of 2013 and the Belgian National Household Travel Survey of 2010. Results indicate that the \{HMM\} method captures the complete heterogeneity of the micro-data contrary to standard fitting approaches. The method provides accurate results as it is able to reproduce the marginal distributions and their corresponding multivariate joint distributions with an acceptable error rate (i.e., SRSME=0.54 for 6 synthesized attributes). Furthermore, the \{HMM\} outperforms \{IPF\} for small sample sizes, even though the amount of input data is less than that for IPF. Finally, simulations show that the \{HMM\} can merge information provided by multiple data sources to allow good population estimates. "

Energy forecasting models for building energy systems are essential to building energy control and operation. Three general categories of building energy forecasting models have been reported in the literature which include white-box (physics-based), black-box (data-driven), and gray-box (combination of physics based and data-driven) modeling approaches.

Because maximizing resection may be beneficial for these patients, improving tumor extent of resection (EOR) with methods such as intraoperative 5-aminolevulinic acid fluorescence-guided surgery (FGS) is currently under evaluation. However, it is difficult to reproducibly judge \{EOR\} in these studies due to the lack of reliable tumor segmentation methods, especially for postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Therefore, a reliable, easily distributable segmentation method is needed to permit valid comparison, especially across multiple sites. We report a segmentation method that combines versatile region-of-interest blob generation with automated clustering methods. We applied this to glioblastoma cases undergoing \{FGS\} and matched controls to illustrate the method's reliability and accuracy. Agreement and interrater variability between segmentations were assessed using the concordance correlation coefficient, and spatial accuracy was determined using the Dice similarity index and mean Euclidean distance. Fuzzy C-means clustering with three classes was the best performing method, generating volumes with high agreement with manual contouring and high interrater agreement preoperatively and postoperatively. The proposed segmentation method allows tumor volume measurements of contrast-enhanced T1-weighted images in the unbiased, reproducible fashion necessary for quantifying \{EOR\} in multicenter trials.

The extended finite element method (XFEM) is employed as the forward solver in the inverse detection framework, where re-meshing requirements in the vicinity of the flaws are completely alleviated. By comparing the measurement data and the output of the \{XFEM\} forward model, Bayesâ theorem is used to update the probability distributions of the flaw parameters, leading to a full statistical quantification of flaws. Since the number of flaws is unknown beforehand, a trans-dimensional reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm is employed for sampling the posterior distributions of flaw parameters within the varying parameter spaces. The \{RJMCMC\} algorithm is guided by predefined prior information which is based on damage indices defined at each sensor location. These indices are obtained by comparing the undamaged and damaged measurement states. Numerical studies are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed statistical multiple-flaw quantification method. "

In this work, we first analyze the current dummy-location selection (DLS) algorithmâan efficient location privacy preservation approach and design an attack algorithm for \{DLS\} (ADLS) for test emerging IoT security. For efficiently preserving user's location privacy, we propose a novel dummy location privacy-preserving (DLP) algorithm by considering both computational costs and various privacy requirements of different users. Extensive simulation experiments have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed schemes. Evaluation results show that the \{ADLS\} algorithm has a high probability of identifying the user's real location out from chosen dummy locations in the \{DLS\} algorithm. Our proposed \{DLP\} algorithm has clear advantages over the \{DLS\} algorithm in term of lower probability of revealing the user's real location and improved computational cost and efficiency (i.e., time, speed, accuracy, and complexity) while preserve the same privacy level as \{DLS\} algorithm.

abstract = "The therapeutic effects of drugs are well known to result from their interaction with multiple intracellular targets. Accordingly, the pharma industry is currently moving from a reductionist approach based on a âone-target fixationâ to a holistic multitarget approach. However, many drug discovery practices are still procedural abstractions resulting from the attempt to understand and address the action of biologically active compounds while preventing adverse effects. Here, we discuss how drug discovery can benefit from the principles of evolutionary biology and report two real-life case studies. We do so by focusing on the desirability principle, and its many features and applications, such as machine learning-based multicriteria virtual screening. "

With the realization of cognitive radio networks came the recognition that both new and old security threats are relevant. The cognitive radio network is still vulnerable to many of the denial of service, wormhole, routing, and jamming attacks that plague other wireless technologies. In addition, the cognitive radio network is vulnerable to new attacks based on cognitive radio innovations, such as spectrum sharing, spectrum sensing, cognitive capability, and radio reconfigurability. The scope of this survey is to present an overview of security threats and challenges to the cognitive radio network, especially focusing on new solutions from 2012 and the first half of 2013. Included are prior mitigation techniques that are adaptive to the new technology, as well as new mitigation techniques specifically targeted at new cognitive radio vulnerabilities. The threats provided are organized according to the protocol layer at which the attack is targeted. "

abstract = "Abstract Situated within science of science, this study analyzes the nature, practice, and impact of \{ICT\} of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability as a form of science and technology (S&amp;T) within the defining context of smart sustainable cities. Specifically, it probes the ways in which this form has emerged from different perspectives, why it has become institutionalized and interwoven with politics and policyâurban dissemination, as well as the risks it poses to environmental sustainability in the context thereof. To achieve these aims, an analytical and philosophical framework of \{STS\} is adopted, which supports analyses and evaluations whose approaches are drawn from a variety of disciplinary and theoretical perspectives. The study shows that smart sustainable cities are discursively construed and materially produced by the socially constructed understandings and socially anchored and institutionalized practices pertaining to \{ICT\} of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability. Thereby, such cities are medicated by and situated within ecologically and technologically advanced societies. And as urban manifestations of scientific knowledge and technological innovation, they are shaped by, and also shape, socioâcultural and politicoâinstitutional structures. In addition, the study demonstrates that the success and expansion of smart sustainable cities stem from the transformational power, knowledge/power relation, productive and constitutive force, and legitimation capacity underlying \{ICT\} of the new wave of computing for urban sustainability due to its association with the scientific discourse and its societal entailments. This form of S&amp;T is, however, shown to pose risks to environmental sustainability. Therefore, it needs to be reoriented in a more environmentally sustainable direction, as it can not, as currently practiced, solve the complex environmental problems placed in the agenda of smart sustainable cities as a holistic approach to urban development.
